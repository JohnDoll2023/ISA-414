However, when any company tells me that I am not wanted as a customer if I do not believe in everything they believe in; I will move on. I do not want to be a mindless follower for any group or company. I love Starbucks coffee, but will move on and find another brand to embrace. Good luck building a cult around Mr. Schultz .... signed, a former customer"
1/29/2017 23:44,"Thank you Starbucks and Mr. Schultz for supporting diversity and everyone in our community.  Screw Strobhar, let him sell his shares and see if he can do a better investment elsewhere."
1/29/2017 23:11,Very unhappy with my last few visits to the massillon ohio store. Waited 15min for coffee to be told they lost my order and had to remake it. Then I wanted a donut which they are always out of. Was  also told that they only put out 2 and once there gone there gone.  If you are going to advertise thing and not put them out why have them. One last thing is they are always busy and you have to wait 20 to 25 mins in the Drive thur. I'm going to give them one last chance to get things in order or I'm not going to back to a Starbucks again.
1/29/2017 22:30,It seems to have very limited selection at the Olympic and Soto  ( Los Angeles) location. Wasn't even able to order the featured items. SMH  Ì†ΩÌ∏î
1/29/2017 22:19,"So here it is ‚Äì almost the end of January ‚Äì and my local Starbucks (South Street in Philadelphia) is still ONLY serving Christmas Blend as dark. Since don‚Äôt brew ANYTHING except Pike Place after 12noon (unless you demand a pour over!) and employees are instructed to only brew the Christmas Blend until it‚Äôs all gone -, AND since they still have a few CASES of CB, we may have to put up with CB until Easter this year. (Remember when SB actually cared about the quality of the coffee they served in their stores?)"
1/29/2017 21:26,"Kudos to your customer service agents!  My Starbucks account was hacked and it wreaked havoc on not only my Starbucks card but my checking account.  My credit union credited me back the $$ and your CS rep took care of making sure everything was as it should be, shutting down the ""bad"" gold card, ordering me a new one and getting my balance back to what it was before this all started.  AND, she even threw an extra $10 on top----greatly appreciated.  She was super sweet, professional and a pleasure to speak with.  Thank you, Starbucks!"

1/29/2017 19:20,Thank you for the birthday reward for my birthday on Jan 27th. Went to redeem it and then realized you only gave me 1 day when I went to redeem it on Jan 29th. You used to give more time. So we are just out of luck if we can't run right down to Starbucks ???  Not nice !!
1/29/2017 18:54,"Watch Amazon film, ""Barista"" - it is so fun and you see what it really means to be a coffee expert.  It is fun to watch, if you are a Starbucks fan like I am.  Starbucks is not mentioned in the film."
1/29/2017 18:05,"I purchased a pound of Samantra whole bean coffee at my local Starbuck store in Woodbride, VA and it tasted like it was decades old...  horrabe."
1/29/2017 18:02,"I went onto the Starbucks page and filled out the form to register a complaint about a barista. I had already mentioned it to the manager the next morning, but still wanted who ever to know about it. This happened about a week ago. I had ordered my coffee in the morning and didn't check before I pulled away from the drive thru. I got to work and had the wrong drink but didn't have time to fix it, I stopped in after work. I explained what happened and pulled up to the window. I was then asked, ""Do you have the cup?"" which I did. She then asked me ""Did you drink it or dump it?"" I have NEVER been asked this before. I was always under the impression that no matter what a drink would be fixed. I know a barista and when I told her what happened she was even shocked and told me to complain. I got the impression that this barista has had issues before with her customer service. When I told them the next morning what had happened the barista was apologetic but like well she doesn't know you like we do. Why would that matter? Yes the problem was taken care of but still customer service is very important in a business and the young lady was rude."
1/29/2017 16:32,"Can you tell me how to order a SKINNY Vanilla Latte from the mobile app? Also, how to order a Skinny Caramel Macchiato using the mobile app?"
1/29/2017 16:02,Why are you still promoting the sale of the Lunar Rooster when it is Out of Stock?  It's an awful tease.
1/29/2017 15:51,"Dear Starbucks,
   As a type 1 diabetic and lover of coffee I just wanted to share my disgust with the amount of sugar that gets shoveled into almost every drink that gets sold. How did we get to a point where the 'standard' drink comes with tablespoon after tablespoon of sugar? Moreover, the prepackaged items rarely, if ever, have a low or zero sugar option. I love your coffee but for my health and others, please reduce the sugar content. 

Ps- the global population of diabetics is about 390 million people, not to mention the millions of other people with dietary issues that require low/no sugar content"
1/29/2017 15:10,Will you ever have vegan treats at Starbucks?
1/29/2017 14:11,"I have a question about star dashes.  When you have to make x amount of purchases, what qualifies as a purchase?  Is it number of items ordered, or is a purchase each transaction.  The barista doesn't know and I feel a little silly having all my items rang up separately, especially if not needed.  I would love it if you could clear this up for me.  Thank you."
1/29/2017 13:46,"In the Starbucks cofee (Bucharest,Platza Mall) the employees doesn't stpos customers from smokes and even encourages them to smokes; they doesn't respect the law.I am desapointed"
1/29/2017 12:36,"I am so angry with the lady working behind the counter at the Louetta /Steubner Airline location in Spring, TX. Nearly every morning I sit in my driveway at 5:55am and order my coffee on the mobile app. It's convenient, paid for right away, and ready for me when I get to the store. Ready for me is a plus, since I can't have caffeine and usually Starbucks has to make the Decaf at the time of my order. Every once in a while the app won't show this particular location as a place for pick up, and I have to go to the store to order and pay for my coffee. That happened this morning. So I headed to the store and got there at 6:01am to order. I was first in line with a lady behind me. The lady behind the counter evidently took it personally when I mentioned that the app couldn't find them again today. She rudely stated, ""Well, we literally just opened 48 seconds ago, so..."" 
I said that I always order from my driveway at 5 minutes before opening so I can pick it up on my way to work. She again copped a rude tone and said, ""Well then you're the ONLY one. I've got customers who work at LA Fitness who have to wait until we open before ordering!"" I was embarrassed after that. Because she insinuated that I'm a liar. Because she spoke to me in an argumentative and condescending tone in front of another employee AND another customer. And, to top it all off, she then was as sweet as could be to the lady behind me, asking how her morning was going, etc. That's when I knew she wasn't just a sullen person to everyone. Just me. 
The sad part is there's not another Starbucks near my house that makes Decaf. Yes, that's right. Certain stores don't even have Decaf. I wish I could recreate my drink at home, then I could avoid angry employees all together. Too bad I don't know her schedule there. I would certainly stay away the days she works. I hate the thought if giving up my comfort drink. But I will not be spoken to in that manner again. And now, I begin my nursing shift trying to rid myself of the negativity I feel after her rudeness."

1/29/2017 2:02,"Dear Starbucks, 
Just want you to know how disappointed my family and friends are at your establishment on 970 Alamo Dr, Vacaville, CA 95687. My friend came in around 9 am today to ask management if she could set up a fundraising booth on the sidewalk between your establishment and the gas station next door. The fundraiser was offering the purchase of products with a portion going towards the cost of an autism service dog for my son. Since there was no manager on duty, shift leader Maxine, said 'no'. So my friend walked next door to the gas station convenient store (who owns the property, according to the barista that asked Maxine) and was granted permission. My friend and I set up the booth next to the convenient store. Around 3pm, cops showed up. Apparently, Maxine and my friend have a prior history. Maxine told Co workers that she asked us to leave the premise twice, when she never did! She barely said 'hi' when taking out the trash. So the Co workers called the cops based on Maxine's suggestion, and after being there for 6 hours, the cops asked my friend to leave. 
2 problems with this. 1, We are out in the general area, fundraising for a child in need. Autism is something that is very difficult to live with, this dog we're raising money for will help my son tremendously.  2, we were not soliciting anything. People came up to us if they were curious about our cause. The most we said to passing customers were ""good morning, have a good day"". Your employee told a bold face lie about asking us to leave, much less twice! Because she has a personal vendetta against my friend, does not give her the right to be a coward, and have a fellow employee call the cops on her. Today, that employee made Starbucks as a corporation look really bad. The manager will be called on Monday and informed about this situation."

Barista's are so professional especially Erin. Keep up the good work."
1/29/2017 0:29,"I had a chilled drink created by the barista at Starbuck's in the Safeway store at 1781 Forest Drive in Annapolis, Maryland, that was excellent. It was made with strawberry, vanilla bean, and mango. I don't know the barista's name. He was working on Friday, January 27, 2017 in the morning before 10 am. I recommend that you contact him and arrange for the introduction of that drink to Starbucks menu. Thank you."
1/30/2017 23:59,Thanks for hiring refugees AND Veterans through the Starbucks Partners - Armed Forces Network!

YOU LOST MY BUSINESS STARBUCKS!!! What about American Citizens (Not including the Vets) that want to work for you...... Disappointed..."
1/30/2017 23:57,"As the owners of the company, you can do what you please.  But you forget it's your customers that have made you what you are.  With there being so many unemployed and underemployed Americans, how dare you commit to putting non-Americans above the people that put you in that fancy office.  It's time, we as a nation, start to think of what's best for Americans.  You have lost more customers than you realize.  So, please continue with your un-Ameican stance.  Soon you will be unemployed or underemployed and you will finally understand what people are talking about."
1/30/2017 23:56,"Instead of hiring 10K refugees, why don't you hire 10K veterans??"
1/30/2017 23:55,Please include Veterans in your hiring along with the refugees Thanks
1/30/2017 23:54,"WOW!
I never thought I'd write this, 
but here it goes:

Also, could you please open a Starbucks in Gaza and share the love with Palestinians? ;)"
1/30/2017 23:54,Overpriced garbage. Doesn't surprise me you'd step over someone who stepped up. Cowards. Every last one of you snowflakes.
1/30/2017 23:54,"Thank you Starbucks!  Thank you for taking a side! 

In the words of Elie Wiesel ~ I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere. When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant. Wherever men or women are persecuted because of their race, religion, or political views, that place must ‚Äì at that moment ‚Äì become the center of the universe."
1/30/2017 23:53,great news starbucks now served sans bigots !

1/30/2017 23:51,boycottstarbucks never buying coffee from you guys again
1/30/2017 23:50,Done with you!
1/30/2017 23:50,"Thank you Starbucks, for standing up against the evil cabal. Thank you for showing integrity."
1/30/2017 23:49,Thank you so much for your stellar committment to our republic. Your company epitomizes the true America.
1/30/2017 23:48,Thank you for supporting the refugees.  I will be coming to your place of business to buy things to support you.  <3
1/30/2017 23:48,Will no longer support Starbucks
1/30/2017 23:48,Thank you for standing with refugees.

1/30/2017 23:45,"Thank you, Starbucks!!!"
1/30/2017 23:45,Looks like I won't be buying your overpriced coffee products anymore! Hire a veteran instead!

1/30/2017 23:40,Every AMERICAN should stop buying their products! Let all illegals make money for ghem. Never went there before and sure won't now!!!
1/30/2017 23:39,"Vets and Americans who need work and you hire Refugees? 
BANNED!!!!!"
1/30/2017 23:38,Will never get a penny of my money when you hire refugees before Americans
1/30/2017 23:38,There are other places to buy expensive coffee:  Maybe time to boycott Starbucks and spend out money on companies hire Americans.
1/30/2017 23:38,My family and friends and the kids of Albiani and Pleasant grove High will boycott Starbucks! Thats over 2000 plus kids and family!
1/30/2017 23:37,I will NO longer support support Starbucks Coffee due to the new hiring policy concerning the hiring of refugees in the next 5 years especially since there are millions of Americans without jobs in the United States NOW!!!! What kind of idiotic logic does that make. I ask that EVERYONE BOYCOTT Starbucks until they resend this new hiring policy!!!!!!!!!
1/30/2017 23:37,"why would you hire refugees over current US citizens, This stupid reaction is why Trump got elected. boycottstarbucks."
1/30/2017 23:37,So a CEO will be hiring Refugees over Americans  ... In 2 years many democrats are up for re-election ... lets see how they do.  As for Starbuck's How about Hiring the American Homeless and Veterans first or is your alliance with foreign countries?  America First!  America Strong!
1/30/2017 23:36,"So I'm just wondering why not 10,000 US Veterans instead?"
1/30/2017 23:35,"Maybe you should try hiring more Americans!  How about veterans, high school students, what about all those people that are unemployed???  Anyone that chooses to support you after this statement is just as terrible as your company!"
1/30/2017 23:34,"I LOVE that you have pledged to hire 10,000 refugees. My daughter buys Starbucks all the time. Me, not so much, I pay the bills and you are a treat; but, I will be going out of my way to buy Starbucks more often."
1/30/2017 23:34,"Maybe you should stick to making coffee and stay out of politics, McDonalds will take my money and cost a lot less."
1/30/2017 23:31,I'll be getting a cup every time I go to Target!
1/30/2017 23:31,"‚ÄãI have owned stock for the last 15 years! I'm done! You no longer have my business. You do not spit in my face. I'm an American, this will not go without a fight from the citizens who help this business grow for many years. ‚ÄãYour choice to not support our President and speak in a manner that was disrespectful reveals the true mask you've been wearing. Welcome to the USA Starbucks. Let's see how the protesters who don't have jobs are going to support your company without mommy & daddy's money. Then again they might not be able to find employment with your company as they only hold degrees from the USA!"
1/30/2017 23:30,"Did you ever considering hiring 10,000 vets, or is that just not ""cool"" enough?"
1/30/2017 23:29,Done with you... not another cent to be spent with you...
1/30/2017 23:28,I will be coming in every chance I get.
1/30/2017 23:27,"Thank you Starbucks for standing up for what is right. People say we can't take refugees because they will be a drain on our society. You offer them work. Now those same people accuse you of hiring refugees instead of Americans, but you ALREADY hired vets and students!! Haters want to hate and they will, no matter what! Stay strong and continue to do right! You will profit more from that in the long run."
1/30/2017 23:25,"So, if you email starbucks telling them you want your money back from a gold card, they give you a case number and telephone number. Call them, they close your account and send you a check in 30 days for your balance amount. My money can be spent elsewhere."
1/30/2017 23:25,We go to Starbucks religiously..and was told that the Skinny / Sugar Free Mocha syrup is being discontinues!!   I sure hope that isn't the case..especially when the majority of the US is cutting down sugars from their diet. Our family only drinks beverages with sugar free options and the skinny mocha syrup is the star in those drinks. Would hate to leave the Starbucks fam to go elsewhere.
1/30/2017 23:22,"Your CEO stated today he is going to hire 10,000 refugees in a direct attack on President Trumps agenda ....... Really???? We have an unemployment rate that is through the roof, at the very least hire legal American citizens first!!! However, I'm not surprised as your company is located in the heart of left wing madness. I will  ""NEVER, EVER AGAIN"" (nor will my company) spend another penny supporting you or your products."
1/30/2017 23:22,"I'll just say if you want to be a good corp citizen, how about a program supporting minorities and if you want to support refugees it can support 10 in a safe zones verses 1 in the USA. So until that happens will not suport your company and I have a choice!!! What a joke!!!"
1/30/2017 23:21,iv never been a huge fan of sb coffee. but reading about the refuge policy has made me a huge fan. Im supporting starbucks from now on! great position !  This world needs more kindness !
1/30/2017 23:21,"Due to your proposal to hire 10,000 refugees in its stores worldwide, I will START regularly supporting Star Bucks!

"
1/30/2017 23:19,I love Starbucks. I love you even more when you support the same causes I do. I visit your store on 73rd & Columbus (NYC) every. single. morning. I would love to buy food and coffee from your 88th & Broadway store (also NYC) every single afternoon when I am at work but I cannot. That store has an impossibly long line every day and they are always out of anything I try to order.  Always. I would spend $5-$10 a day at the 88th & Broadway store but I cannot until you change because you have no supplies and an unreasonable wait time. Let me know when the problem is fixed and I would be more than happy to spend lots of money there. Thank you!
1/30/2017 23:19,"Hiring refugees is kindhearted,  I wont say it's not..... But to hire them before the thousands of Americans that are unemployed,  and the many Veteran's that are on our streets is wrong!!  

As much as I like your coffee..... I won't stand by your political views.  Henceforth,  I will no longer spend my money at your store(s)!!!!"
1/30/2017 23:19,"Dear Starbucks, 

I'm a broke law student, but I'm changing my morning route to buy my coffee at your Hyde Park Chicago location so that I can thank you for supporting refugees and standing up to Donald Trump.  

Please take further steps by refusing to renew  leases for your locations on Trump properties!"
1/30/2017 23:18,I'll take any Starbucks cards and/or merchandise that any of you boycotters are tossing!!!
1/30/2017 23:18,"Starbucks, an American company actively trying to keep Americans unemployed. But Tullys coffee or any other pro American coffee stand you can find."
1/30/2017 23:18,"To the Starbucks Corporation, as the wife of a uniformed service member, I want to applaud your pledge to employ refugees.  Thank you for the ray of hope in a frightening time, and for demonstrating humanity in the realm of business."
1/30/2017 23:17,goodbye Starbucks i drive in just about everyday and get a cup of coffee but after what you said this morning about hiring refugees i am done with you sad when a company gets into politics
1/30/2017 23:17,I will spread it far and wide that you hate America.

We stand with you.
Thank you."
1/30/2017 23:14,Thank you for your support and promise to immigrants.  I'll be stopping by for coffee tomorrow in support.
1/30/2017 23:12,"Thank you Starbucks! I am proud of your CEO for standing by his beliefs. I hope that the negative opinions of the CEO's plan does not deter him from taking action. I feel like every single time I turn around Starbucks is in hot water with some one, but Starbucks always comes out on top. And as long as Starbucks continues to act with others in their heart I believe the company will stay on top."
1/30/2017 23:12,Glad to be boycotting this business that will hire refugees over veterans or even regular Americans.
1/30/2017 23:12,"Why isn't Starbucks hiring Americans.  They'll hire l0,000 illegals.
They'll take my money but don't seem to be hiring unemployed Americans."

1/30/2017 23:10,Starbucks going to employ refugees?......I just threw out all my Starbucks cards......screw Starbucks!
1/30/2017 23:08,I wish Starbucks cared as much about veterans as they do about refugees...
1/30/2017 23:08,"how about instead hiring some of the 50,000 homeless US veterans, Starbucks? they're the ones you should thank for the freedom to sell your ridiculously-overpriced coffee!"
1/30/2017 23:07,"Starbucks betray America all the time now instead of looking after their own countrymen and helping the unemployed they want to employ 10,,000 refugees, the CEO is a drop kick at best who is more interested in his own political agenda than the well being of the company. No business should be sacrificed for those reasons this guy is a true sociopath he needs to go."
1/30/2017 23:07,"The problem with stating what you believe and then putting actions behind it is that a vast majority of people have no idea why or what or anything and so, they boycott, complain, curse, etc.  How about, ""Thanks Mr Schulz for trying to help poor people around the world since our government has (at least temporarilly) stepped aside.  No one said he was going to REPLACE Americans and that ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WERE COOL.,...Geez, it's just knowing the language that seems to be missing here."
1/30/2017 23:07,I have lost all respect and will never spend my hard earned money at your stores.  Hiring illegal immigrants is against the law and taking jobs away from AMERICAN CITIZENS is disrespectful.  I hope other customers decide to take their AMERICAN DOLLARS ELSEWHERE!
1/30/2017 23:06,Hire veterans and unemployed US citizens first! No more purchases from your establishment until you put American citizens first!
1/30/2017 23:04,Starbucks should hire American citizens first. You will lose my business if this happens....
1/30/2017 23:04,Thank you for standing up against hatred. I will be making more visits to Starbucks. All people deserve a decent life. A lot of these refuges have seems horrors that most people will never comprehend. The world needs to see love instead of hate. Thank you for helping people that really need it.
1/30/2017 23:03,Kudos to your CEO for committing to hire refugees around the world.  Great response to the US gov missteps on immigrstion
1/30/2017 23:03,Dissapointed that Starbucks decided to commit a crime by hiring ilegal aliens.  You will not get any business from me.
1/30/2017 23:02,Boycott Starbucks for not hiring Americans first.
1/30/2017 22:59,"If the article is true about Starbucks hiring refugees, then thank you for standing up to Trump!"
1/30/2017 22:58,how about hiring the Vets and homeless instead of refugees???? it's a wonder why alot of people don't go to Starbucks!!! Duncan Donuts is a lot better!!!

1/30/2017 22:57,"We have roughly 40,000 Homeless Veterans in America but rather hire these men that were willing to sacrifice their lives for you to have a business you pledge to hire 10,000 immigrants.

1/30/2017 22:56,"Hiring 10,000 refugees? Anti trump? Ahhhh this company just gets better and better.

1/30/2017 22:54,"WELL DONE. It is one thing to support refugees, veterans and at-risk populations generally with lip-service. It is an entirely different situation to support them in deed. I applaud you."
1/30/2017 22:53,Hire  refuges?  Why don't yall hire  VETERANS?  I'm boycotting your establishment for sure now!
1/30/2017 22:53,Thank you for standing up for what's right!  Loyal customer Ì†ΩÌ≤ï
1/30/2017 22:52,"Yeah Starbucks! The only starbuck is very much out of the way, but I will be making an effort to go there. I will support you!! <3"
1/30/2017 22:52,Thank you for hiring vets and refugees
1/30/2017 22:52,"My husband and I buy starbucks every VA appointment he has. No more. You put a store in a veterans clinic in Toledo Ohio and want the veterans to buy up your product, suck money off them but you put 10000 refugees over the Americans you profit off of? There are jobless vets, homeless men and women stuck in a trap. You obviously have the ability to help people in need but just not homless people or vets that fought for your ability to profit off the American people. Your thinking.. 10k refugees = more people to advertise sales to. Your highly inflated coffee prices are just a reflection of that.  You manipulate the public into thinking youre ""charitable"" and ""humanitarian"" but youre really a money hungry fraud."
1/30/2017 22:52,I am done supporting Starbucks. I will never go there again because they have chosen to hire refugees over United States citizens. We have plenty of our own people who need a job. Bad decision Starbucks.
1/30/2017 22:50,I have just switched my coffee and tea drinking to Starbucks only
1/30/2017 22:49,Thank you Starbucks for standing up against HATE!  You have my support!
1/30/2017 22:49,Thanks. Will double my Starbucks intake now.
1/30/2017 22:48,"Thank you for continuing to be awesome! I don't feel so guilty about spending hundreds of dollars on lattes a year when I know it supports a company that, in turn, supports human rights & compassion for all."
1/30/2017 22:48,"Good for you, Starbucks. Keep standing strong against bigotry and insanity."
1/30/2017 22:47,"I've been a very loyal customer for many years and have spent thousands of dollars at Starbucks. Given your irresponsibility, stating you'll hire 10,000 illegal refugees in the next 5 years, I will no longer patronize your company. What a disgrace and a slap in the face to the thousands of men and women of our armed forces who have allowed you to be FREE to do all of the things you obviously take for granted. 

Why are you not boldly stating you'll hire 10,000 American Veterans? 

It's also an insult to Americans in general, including me, my family, my friends and my co-workers. None of us (and this is A LOT of people) will spend our hard earned money at Starbucks anymore. 
You are a disgrace to our nation. How sad.

You truly deserve the massive loss of revenue you'll experience and the negative publicity."
1/30/2017 22:45,Boycotting overpriced Starbuks!!! Bucking the Starbucks!
1/30/2017 22:44,"Thank you, Starbucks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We appreciate your efforts to protect American and more importantly human values!"
1/30/2017 22:44,Why dont you do the right thing and start up Starbucks in those country that they are coming from then you could employ in their countries OHHH that right you arent allowed
1/30/2017 22:43,"I haven't been to a Starbucks in months, but I'll see you tomorrow morning."
1/30/2017 22:41,I think Howard Schultz (sp?) decision to hire refugees is positive so long as they are NOT illegals.
1/30/2017 22:40,Good job protecting immigrants. Will buy from you more often now.
1/30/2017 22:40,"Dumped the Starbucks stock from my retirement portfolio today. You picked your side, I picked mine."
1/30/2017 22:40,"I'm finished with Starbucks the liberal support that comes from this corporation, I'm Christian white middle class male, I'm not a racist but I'm America first in my thinking and pro 2nd amendment. BTW Tullys makes better coffee anyhow."
1/30/2017 22:38,"I'm so baffled by the people who call themselves Christians, who also call for a Starbucks boycott.  I, for one, thank you, Starbucks, for taking a stand, and helping those who need it.  I will continue to support your corporation, now more than ever!"
1/30/2017 22:36,"Well, Starbucks, it's been a good run.  I've been a customer for as long as you've been in VA.  But now I'm done thanks to your temper tantrum you're throwing towards Trump.  You seem to forget that there are plenty of people that DO support him and we're fed up with the behavior we're witnessing from liberals all across the country.  I'm so done with Starbucks."
1/30/2017 22:35,Starbucks thank you for stepping up for human rights and refugees. This makes your coffee taste all that much better today!
1/30/2017 22:34,Do you want to hire 10000 veterans or refugees... make up your mind!
1/30/2017 22:34,"Hearing the recent news, I will now start buying Starbucks.  You may need some support.  Bold move."
1/30/2017 22:33,you really want to alienate half of the country...
1/30/2017 22:31,"I am no longer a supporter of the Starbucks Franchise.  I know I am just one person.  None the less, as a true company you should care about losing even just one."
1/30/2017 22:30,"Starbucks, your response to this ban by employing non-American citizens at the expense of Americans who would need that position has me upset at you to say the least. You are recklessly allowing unemployment and shorter shifts and I cannot and will not support this idea behind your actions. I will be making my own coffee from now on until you decide to reverse this notion that you are doing this for America while giving away jobs to those not of America. I am willing to be served by a snowflake, a liberal or even a Muslim as long as they are American but not by someone who is fleeing their country instead of taking up arms like our own brave soldiers to protect their own country from terrorists and those seeking to overrun it with lawlessness and a disregard to human life. Unemployment may be low at this point in time but that is no excuse to jeopardize it just to give a slap to the face of any politician. You are no different than any other company seeking to move over seas and fill their offices with other nations while bleeding the American people dry. We need jobs just as much as they do.

How can we support others when we can hardly support ourselves?"
1/30/2017 22:28,"Thank you Starbucks for taking a stand to help the less fortunate. It's always nice to see a company do the right thing, even when it would be easier to do nothing."
1/30/2017 22:24,"I currently purchase approximately 3 times a day at Starbucks stores. Approx $9 to $15 every day,365 days a year, LOL. 
I am considering taking my business elsewhere because of the comments from your CEO. I thought that's an anti American statement. 
So sad"
1/30/2017 22:24,Most homeless and veterans wouldn't take a job if offered at Starbucks.   They had their chance now let someone who wants to work make my coffee!!!!!!
1/30/2017 22:24,"Thank you, Starbucks for your inspiring stand regarding Trump's current ban on immigrants and refugees."
1/30/2017 22:23,Too many homeless at your locations.
1/30/2017 22:23,"As someone who was told that I wasn't flexible enough with my hours so wasn't hireable, why couldn't you start off by helping single parents, or veterans, or homeless."
1/30/2017 22:22,"My ignorance on the issue has been made apparent. I'm glad to hear they are doing this.

Why don't you pledge to hire 10k veterans instead of refugees. VetsFirst"
1/30/2017 22:22,Why don't you hire AMERICANS over the next 5 years instead of those people? I was right about your company not backing the American people
1/30/2017 22:20,Boycott Starbucks. ...stay out of politics
1/30/2017 22:18,"congratulations to all your employees- your Board, Howard Schultz for his leadership and courage--   I was in your store in Seattle the first day you opened and could not be prouder to be supporterr!! congrats and thank you for demonstrating corporate leadership and values and for Howard for standing up!! you are the best!"

1/30/2017 22:15,Thank you Starbucks!  For your support of veterans AND refugees and for being an awesome company to work for!
1/30/2017 22:13,We will support you Starbucks! I am so sorry to see many people wrote boycotting tweets and messages.
1/30/2017 22:12,I will no longer buy Starbucks after hearing their news statment about hiring  ten thousand illegal people because president Trump is trying to keep us safe.  A former customer
1/30/2017 22:12,Can you please confirm your hiring practices.  I'd like to hear it from you.  Thank you.
1/30/2017 22:11,You suck and yes I am unliking your page!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1/30/2017 22:10,Thank you for shining a moral light in a dark time. Our family are heavy Starbucks hitters....we will continue our patronage. Thank you for embracing refugees!
1/30/2017 22:09,Thank you Starbucks for your recent statement about helping out the refugees... We are your biggest fan!
1/30/2017 22:09,Thank you for making an effort to hire people who are less privileged!
1/30/2017 22:09,"So Starbucks are going to employ 10,000 refugees worldwide over the next 5 years. Isn't that discrimination against residents of those countries who are unemployed, may have families to provide for and would be willing to work for Starbucks ... even at a few pence per hour over minimum wage? 
Will Starbucks put a sign up stating ""Job Vacancies, Apply Inside ... Only Refugees Considered!"" Can you actually do that? I can see your good intentions but by employing refugees ahead of country folk who have paid their way for years (maybe all of their lives) and are unfortunately out of work is wrong to me? It is discrimination whatever way you look at it. In trying to stand up against Trump it will make you the same as him!"
1/30/2017 22:08,"Thank you for standing up to Trump and supporting the values of America. We are all immigrants unless you are Native people. My ancestors founded this country arriving on all the first boats. Patriotism runs long and deep in my family. I won't support the hate of this administration, and I will purchase an extra drink a day from you to make up the difference in income you may have lost from a Trump supporter. Thank you again!"
1/30/2017 22:08,Thank you starbucks for standing for what is right!!! I'll always be a happy customer.
1/30/2017 22:07,I am boycotting this organization due to your CEO's actions. If he wants only refugee's perhaps he should move to another country! Oh I forgot he is the ultra rich and they will not affect him!! Her just wants to save money on Obamacare then why didn't he protest when it was being passed as a law!!! Shameful and classless.
1/30/2017 22:05,Hire veterans first!!!! I'm DONE with Starbucks.
1/30/2017 22:04,You'd hire refugees over American's??? Maybe they should be your entire customer base as well. I can do without Starbucks.
1/30/2017 22:03,"Instead of refugees, hire veterans and start work programs for underprivileged people and the unemployed.  You have lost my business."
1/30/2017 22:03,"Dear Starbucks; I have avoided you for years in defense of my beloved small coffee shops, but today I'm coming back. Thank you. thankyoustarbucks nomuslimban"
1/30/2017 22:02,Time to boycott Starbucks...let the silent majority final stand together. Hire whoever you want but we will buy wherever we want.  I can do without my daily white chocolate mocha...
1/30/2017 22:01,GO TRUMP.  NO ONE DRINKS YOUR NASTY SKANKY COFFEE
1/30/2017 22:00,Hiring Refugees over American Citizens..... how Patriotic Starbucks is!!! NEVER AGAIN!!
1/30/2017 22:00,"so Starbucks erases posts huh when someone wants something clarified about their anti American policy.. their ceo said they are hiring 10k refugees, hmm where is the help with the inner city unemployment problem and the vets who need jobs this will probably be takin down cause they are anti American and just out for your dollars they care not about this country so Boycott Starbucks till they change their policies"
1/30/2017 21:59,"There are some miserable people complaining on this page. Jeez, don't buy Starbucks if it outrages you that some refugees (not all of them in the US!) are going to be hired. In the meantime, thanks, Starbucks. Most of us appreciate what you're doing."
1/30/2017 21:59,"I used to work for Starbucks and meet and talked with Howard on many occasions. Although I understand his compassion for helping refugees, I have to completely disagree with his position on hiring refugees in other countries. If he wants to help that is great but why not send bottled water and food to help them now. Helping now with aid would impact so many more people than hiring 10000 in 5 years. The ones that are hired now would be impacted but what good will hiring some in 4 years. If it is so crucial to help now by making a bold statement that will take 5 years to help it is only for political reasons not because you truly want to help. I am very disappointed in your level of help just to go against our President just to try to speak to who you think are your customers and try to keep then happy. We deplorables are your customers and employees as well. How about getting behind a national Starbucks volunteer day and donate $$ per hour served in various ways like assisting veterans. Take care of our own.  AMERICA'S FIRST!!!!"
1/30/2017 21:59,Cancelled my card today
1/30/2017 21:59,"Thank you for standing up for human rights, Starbucks! I support you and will be a much more frequent customer."
1/30/2017 21:59,Thank you for supporting immigrants and the LGBT community.
1/30/2017 21:58,"Thank you Starbucks, for your commitment to hiring both refugees and veterans. Now we're even bigger fans than we already were! I've shared your announcement about hiring refugees with more than 16,000 like-minded Georgians, many of whom are excited to stop by a Starbucks this week to thank you."
1/30/2017 21:57,Thank you Starbucks!  I don't usually buy coffee out but I will make a point to patronize you now!
1/30/2017 21:57,"I heard on the news today that Starbucks plans to hire 10,000 refugees in 75 Countries. If there are 10,000 jobs available in your company over the next 5 years why not focus on the homeless already in those countries?"
1/30/2017 21:56,The January tumbler was an awesome way to pass this dreary month. Such a great deal too.  One suggestion would be to change the design of the tumbler cap. I had a problem where the liquid would come out drips at time then suddenly without warning it would gush out. At times burning my tongue and lips. I chose to transfer the coffee to another mug. Worked for me Ì†æÌ¥ó‚òïÔ∏è
1/30/2017 21:55,Thank you Starbucks for supporting all people!! Jesus would be proud! Ì†ΩÌ±ç
1/30/2017 21:55,Thank you Starbucks.  Your decision to hire thousands of refugees as a response to Trumps order has made my decision to never EVER patronize a Starbucks easy to make.  How about hiring citizens of whatever country you are operating in first.
1/30/2017 21:54,Thank you for standing up for human rights.
1/30/2017 21:54,Thank you Starbucks. I'll continued buying and enjoying your coffee.

1/30/2017 21:52,"10,000 refugees being hired by Starbucks over next 5 years................seriously"
1/30/2017 21:52,What about hiring our veterans instead? It is a real shame you think you need to be involved in politics.
1/30/2017 21:52,"I'm not a big fan of Starbucks coffee....however, I just read the following article about a committment to hire refugees.  I will make it a point to stop in from time to time and purchase Starbucks coffee and tea!"
1/30/2017 21:50,"Good for you. Hiring 10,000 refugees. And leaving 10,000 Americans who would love to work for you out of a job. The inner cities are desperate for jobs. How does someone take an order when they don't speak English? Do you think they will be happy cleaning restrooms? Your heart may be filled with compassion for these people but how about hiring 10,000 Americans too."
1/30/2017 21:49,"Thank you, Starbucks, for once again taking a stand against hatred and racism and being such a great humanitarian.  You're the best!!!"
1/30/2017 21:49,"Thank you for: 
1. Committing to hire refugees.

1/30/2017 21:48,"I want to say how much I appreciate the public statements from the very top of Starbucks Corporate office that affirms their commitment to good public policy, including a promise to hire immigrants and continue with their respected employees. Thanks, Starbucks- this is an unsolicited, but enthusiastic thumbs-up."
1/30/2017 21:47,I will not be boycotting you because you're hiring refugees - as a matter of fact I'll go out of my way to buy my coffee at Starbucks
1/30/2017 21:47,"I went out of my way to buy coffee from your store this morning. Thanks for the humanitarian pledge of hiring 10,000 Refugees."
1/30/2017 21:46,"My dearest Starbucks. I support you and all you are doing to stand up to this current regime. However, I'm also trying to cut back on sugar. Could you please start carrying the Tazo light chai, that has fewer grams?"
1/30/2017 21:46,Thank you for shining a light in the hate.

1/30/2017 21:41,"Will never have another anything from your place again. Don't need 10,000 refugees serving me coffee."
1/30/2017 21:41,"I like the President`s attitude: he just doesnt talk he acts in the right direction. If your company now looks for a cheap marketing campaign by hiring refugees is as poor as your - so called - coffee's taste. Huge dislike for Starbucks, even bigger like for Donald."
1/30/2017 21:40,Thank you Starbucks!
1/30/2017 21:40,"Thank you Starbucks! I have been a customer since you opened the first cafe in Chicago and will continue to support you. It's also nice to know that the hostile, narrow minded Trump supporters will not be there. Phew, a calm and safe place.

1/30/2017 21:29,"That would be cool if Starbucks cared about Americans. Maybe they could have been well on their way to hiring 10,000 homeless Americans? I will not be buying anything from your company anymore."
1/30/2017 21:29,"Instead of propagating the problem of foreign threats on American soil why don't you hire 10000 veterans that need work and are already citizens. Your company was founded in Seattle, Wa, United States. It's the United States citizens that have made your company yet you go out of your way to hire immigrants before your own countryman. I will no longer support your business in any capacity. You have turned your back on the country that has made you successful. Congrats Starbucks, you're about to see some serious losses in your quarterly earnings."
1/30/2017 21:29,Nice work Starbucks .. hire refugees and not Americans? Try hiring some Vets ! Lost my business and will certainly make it known to everyone I know as well

This is a Democracy and it's the RIGHT thing to do. My father was an immigrant and he because a Marine Corps Officer, a lawyer, and then a Federal Judge. He was a productive, hard working man with moral integrity unlike Trump and those in his administration. I think they SHOULD BE BANNED! When I see the children who have had such a difficult time, I could never ever okay this ban."

1/30/2017 21:13,"Un-American,  to hire 10000 refugees, and overlooking the jobless Americans,  and jobless veterans. ......Equal opportunity  employer,  I don't think so, and I think that is against the law.....Choke on your sub-par coffee, I hope this destroys your business. Go sell coffee in the middle east, you traitor!"
1/30/2017 21:11,"Thank you Starbucks for your commitment to all people.  I keep thinking I need to stop spending so much money on coffee, and then you pledge to hire 10,000 refugees, and now you've got me again!  I will be there!  You guys rock!!"
1/30/2017 21:09,"I haven't been to a Starbucks in a long time, but I'll be stopping by this week to show my support!  Thanks for keeping it classy, Starbucks.

(P.S. People that support the Muslim ban == People that hate your holiday cup.  You've really got nothing to lose with this one.)"
1/30/2017 21:07,How about hiring some Veterans instead of refugees.
1/30/2017 21:07,"Starbucks, THANK YOU for your amazing support in hiring both U.S. vets and refugees. I love knowing that my daily coffee supports a forward-thinking, kind, aware company!"
1/30/2017 21:06,Thanks for being a great company that actually cares about people.
1/30/2017 21:06,"This one's for all you parents out there! Enjoy! 

Starbucks Lyrics

I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
Waking up to a loud shout, ah
Every toy in the house out, ah
Just stubbed my toe on Elmo, ah
Please somebody wake me up
I need some coffee asap, ah
Oh I'm feeling like a zombie, ah
Struggling from insomnia

House so dirty, need a latte
Oh you better make a grande
Grind those beans into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking drinks, no not lemonade
I'm looking tired, I put on my shades
Switch up my order, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Look there's the sun
I need I need I need a Starbucks
Look what you've done
I really, really need a Starbucks"
1/30/2017 21:06,I have been a loyal consumer of Starbucks products for over 10 years. But unfortunately recent events and comments by upper management have disgusted me to the point that I will no longer use your products.
1/30/2017 21:05,Going against our new President and hiring refugees - you won't get my business anymore!
1/30/2017 21:05,"Really? 10,000 immigrants? How about hiring 10,000 Veterans? You'll NEVER see another penny of my money...EVER...."
1/30/2017 21:04,Happily went out of our way today to get several coffees at our local Starbucks. Thank you for standing up against intolerance. resist
1/30/2017 21:03,"I will be driving an hour west tomorrow to Augusta, ME to buy Starbucks coffee in support of your stand AGAINST (t)rump's Muslim ban.  Bringing a carload of friends with me!  Thank you for taking Action!"
1/30/2017 21:01,You lost a customer in me and my family for good you want to hire 10000 refugees really how about are usa vets who cant find work hope you go out of business  unreal
1/30/2017 21:01,"Love your coffee, your staff & your continued  commitment to hiring Veterans and refugees!"
1/30/2017 21:00,I will ALWAYS support Starbucks after your pledge to hire refugees!  Big Kudos!!!  <3 <3 <3
1/30/2017 20:59,"I don't exactly know how I am going to drink more coffee, but I will find a way!! Thank you, Starbucks!"
1/30/2017 20:58,Maybe you should start by hiring veterans before refugees.
1/30/2017 20:57,"Sorry but no more Starbucks for me, 10,000 vets hired you know the ones who gave you the right to choose your coffee house......"
1/30/2017 20:57,Thank you Starbucks!! Please continue to stand up for what is right!!
1/30/2017 20:55,Thank you for standing up to bullying and promising to hire Refugees as a strong and tangible reaction to the unconstitutional actions of this illegitimate administration. I'll be buying more products from you to show my support
1/30/2017 20:54,Thank you for supporting refugees!
1/30/2017 20:46,"I support you, Starbucks, and your dedication to veterans and refugees!"
1/30/2017 20:46,"Love Starbucks-- you have the best coffee and the coolest company. I am grateful that you are holding true to the patriotic values of ""one nation, indivisible"". As a nation of refugees and immigrants, with the exception of the only true native people here-- Indigenous people of America--we must extend a hand to those in need. Don't worry-- there are at least 3 million more people who will support you than those who oppose compassion."
1/30/2017 20:45,Done with you. Lost my business and my respect... Too bad.
1/30/2017 20:45,"Way to go, Starbucks! Thank you for being a leader in civil and human rights. You are saving and changing lives."
1/30/2017 20:44,"Thank you Starbucks for taking a stand against anti-American values by hiring refugees! You do Seattle, Washington, and the US proud!"
1/30/2017 20:43,"Hey Starbucks, how about you employ Veterans who helped keep this country free and defended your freedom to make stupid choices."
1/30/2017 20:43,You'll never see another penny from me due to your CEO's political ramblings. I intend to encourage every single person I know to do the same. I'm sure there will be ramifications on your companies bottom line.
1/30/2017 20:42,"My wife loves coffee, Starbucks will be the last place we go now! Do illegals supply your $$$$$$ sales or ????? Legal and hard working Americans? 

Answer please!"
1/30/2017 20:41,Long time daily customer here. I am done with you. Hire all the refuges you want. I will find a better place to spend over $100 per month.
1/30/2017 20:41,"As a Veteran, I am very unhappy with Starbucks decision to put ""refugee's"" ahead of America's vets.   There are at leat 80k homeless vets who would love to have a job.

Yet, you decide to put people from other countries ahead of yours.
I shall never buy another Starbuck's product again.  I shall also encourage others to boycott."
1/30/2017 20:40,Why do you hate America? The homeless in America? Our veterans and all others that are unemployed here?
1/30/2017 20:37,"Dear Starbucks, you are where I go to escape reality. Please serve me tea and stay out of politics starbucks"
1/30/2017 20:36,"You're going to hire 10,000 refugees when so many black (and some white) people are highly unemployed????? FOH!!!

Boycotting"
1/30/2017 20:34,"The wifi at you store on 1430 Monterey Rd
Unit 20, San Jose, CA  95110 is SOO insanely slow that I cannot get my work done nor do anything relaxing online on my lunch break from the school. Please fix!!"
1/30/2017 20:32,Maybe when hiring people you should look closer to home. Maybe you should hire the veterans and homeless that need jobs first?
1/30/2017 20:31,"How nice of you to commit to hiring 10000 immigrants!
teach them basic math then !!!
To hell with americans who are unemployed!
Guess im adding starbucks to my anti American list of venders to replace!
Another form of reverse discrimination... this time to americans.
Sounds like its going to be like 7/11 where all you see working there is primarily foreigners.  Another way to circumvent giving americans jobs. Hope they can speak english and handle cranky Americans when they get their order wrong!
This is gonna suck for the African American workers in chicago airport! They will be replaced with arabic workers in protest to President Trump"
1/30/2017 20:27,"Thank you for doing the right thing.  I have not been a customer in the past, but I will be now.  Also, I just bought Starbucks stocks today.  We need to be the voice for the voiceless.  No matter what happens, know that history will remember you were on the right side."
1/30/2017 20:27,I'm Brazilian and I would like to congratulate you a lot of Starbucks! Honorable attitude and I will start to buy more with you! Good citizens support you
1/30/2017 20:24,"Will never, ever spend another penny at Starbucks."
1/30/2017 20:23,Hey Starbucks you really stepped in it this time.....go ahead and hire all those illegals......wait and see how the Govt. responds.....will be fun to watch.......well you have lost a customer here.....not that I go there that often......like Dunkin Doughnuts much better......dingbats...
1/30/2017 20:23,"Hey Starbucks! I just unliked your page, deleted your app, threw away my gift cards, and will be buying from local coffee houses from now on. Your clearly do not understand who pays your CEO's salary and who your customers are. To say that you will hire refugees over American citizens and especially military veterans, is beyond belief. But I guess I should not be surprised...it seems as though those with a voice use it to speak before they think these days. Hollywood actors, enjoy your Starbucks while us peasants, who obviously can't think for ourselves,  worry about keeping our country safe and secure. BoycottStarbucks BoycottHollywood"
1/30/2017 20:22,"Why don't you hire some American disabled Vets instead. When Starbucks puts refugees before Americans and American safety,
time for me to boycott Starbucks."
1/30/2017 20:21,Thank you for your support of immigrants.  It means a lot to have such a large company make such a substantial commitment and statement.
1/30/2017 20:20,"Shame on Starbucks for not offering those 10,000 jobs to our own unemployed. That tells me where your company values are. Lost a customer!"
1/30/2017 20:19,Sorry but had my last Starbucks cup a joe. Hire some young Black American kids !
1/30/2017 20:18,"I use to like rhis place now they have gone and be come traders to the american people which they will no longer hire instead hire refugees to work insted of americans.  
Good bye Star Bucks"
1/30/2017 20:17,I'll be buying more!
1/30/2017 20:16,"Hey Starbucks,  I hear that your going to hire 10,000 immigrants...how about HIRING 10,000 UNEMPLOYED MILITARY VETERANS...!!!!"
1/30/2017 20:12,"Thank you so much for your stand on helping refugees by offering jobs.  I don't usually buy coffee at Starbucks, but make my own Starbucks at home. I plan on making a point of buying more coffee at Starbucks as a way of showing my support."
1/30/2017 20:09,you have forever lost my business.
1/30/2017 20:09,i have enjoyed starbucks coffee until now after your recent annoucement i will no longer buy your coffee nor will any of my numorous friends.
1/30/2017 20:09,I LOVE LOVE YOUR COFFEE! My family drinks it and now all my friends will be having a cup a day!
1/30/2017 20:08,"You want to make a difference? Announce you are going to hire 10,000 veterans or inner city kids - Americans who need a job"
1/30/2017 20:07,oops... properly vetted refugees as employees maybe???? but over Americans that need a job... prob not .... think im going for racetrac coffee tomorrow !!
1/30/2017 20:06,Disappointed to see your CEO using this public company as a forum to express his personal political views.
1/30/2017 20:06,I just wanted to congratulate Howard Schultz and the rest of your team for coming out against the tragically un-American refuge ban and profiling activities that we are currently witnessing. I applaud your activism and will make an effort to consume more of your coffee as a show of support.
1/30/2017 20:04,"Dear Starbucks, I have loved your coffee ever since you first had a store where I lived at that time. However, I am tired of your company giving political views, and saying you will hire 75000 muslims! I know several people who are not happy with this! I am one of them. Why do you think you have a right to tell politically charged views and give out opinions? I, for one, do NOT want Islamic people who want sharia law, to live in my country!! They all need to move back to their own country where sharia is law. Not here! Not ever. If you insist on this, many of us will not buy from you again."
1/30/2017 20:04,"So you'll hire 10,000 refugees over 5 years? Why not hire more veterans?"
1/30/2017 20:01,"After all the years of buying Starbucks on my way to work, I am officially done with you, now that you are going to hire ""REFUGEES"". Why not hire Americans, after all they are the reason Starbucks is where you are at today. McDonald's here I come., now that Starbucks is being run by a bunch scat-heads!"
1/30/2017 20:00,Their coffee is bitter and overpriced. I did like their chocolate croissants but Dunkin Donuts has them. Bye bye Starbucks.  Hiring to protest Trump? You just lost a customer and also the widow of a 9/11 first responder. Thanks for nothing. I cherish my patriotism. Why don't you hire some homeless veterans? Now there is a question.
1/30/2017 20:00,Great call Starbucks.  Stay the course I will support you and your products!
1/30/2017 19:59,Their coffee is bitter and overpriced. I did like their chocolate croissants but Dunkin Donuts has them. Bye bye Starbucks.  Hiring to protest Trump?

1/30/2017 19:59,I am done with you and your Co.!!!  Why don't you hire Vet's ???
1/30/2017 19:58,"Starbucks, you rock!  Thanks for taking action."
1/30/2017 19:57,"Thank U 4 new, expanded refugee hiring policy"
1/30/2017 19:56,"Why don't you hire US Veterans? You will loose all my future business and I will share my view with everyone I know. Sad that you help divide our nation. 
We got so many jobless Veterans and Americans, take of ours 1st. I hope your company falls off the face of the earth, only sad thing is good America's will loose their jobs, oh maybe they can drink Dunkin Donuts coffee..."
1/30/2017 19:53,Thank you for standing up to tyranny. We stand with you!
1/30/2017 19:52,Thank you Starbucks! Bought my daily Chai Tea this morning!!
1/30/2017 19:51,Thank You for stepping up to help! I will be purchasing more Starbucks!!! For the people boycotting you are hurting veterans also.  Shame on you!
1/30/2017 19:50,"Thank you, Howard!  We're with you.  You're with us.  ~ The Resistance."
1/30/2017 19:49,"If you are going to hire 10,000 refugees, that means 10,000 Americans wouldn't get the chance to work.  I am not going to be your customer anymore"
1/30/2017 19:48,The last few times I have messaged your company with questions/complaints/etc I have not heard back. I know there must be 100's of messages to get through but I even have a question back from October 2016 that was never acknowledged/answered. If you could please take a look at your messages and help me resolve the issue I submitted on Saturday then I would really appreciate it.
1/30/2017 19:47,"Let's quote you Boss:
""And we will start this effort here in the U.S. by making the initial focus of our hiring efforts on those individuals who have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel in the various countries where our military has asked for such support.    ""

How wonderful to forget the service men and women that got shot and some died to protect the interpreters.   Way to keep my whole family out of starbucks."
1/30/2017 19:47,"Hey you elitist socialists:  HOW ABOUT HIRING 10,000 VETS?  Men and women who don't need extreme vetting!!!!  You ungrateful corporate liberals don't deserve our business.  And won't get it!!!!!"
1/30/2017 19:47,"Starbucks, you want my business?? How about hiring qualified candidates not disqualifying me and others because we are not Refugees????? Wow, isn't just hiring refugees a bit of discrimination Starbucks??"
1/30/2017 19:46,"Yay Starbucks!  Leading by example! Don't back down...liberty, justice and lattes for ALL!"
1/30/2017 19:46,We in Northwest Indiana are boycotting for your Blanton disrespect of the president of united States...
1/30/2017 19:45,Will not buy Starbucks......
1/30/2017 19:45,Why do business' have to get political?  We are not interested in your politics - just your products!  There are always two sides and as independent and former Dem and Republican I will take my business elsewhere! Overrated anyway...
1/30/2017 19:44,The entire WERLD needs to try a SCOTTS!  It is a small or medium  blond or pike roast with 2 pumps white mocha and 2 pumps hazelnut.
1/30/2017 19:44,Thank you for the reminder that I need to go top up my Starbucks card.  nomuslimban
1/30/2017 19:43,"Why don't you hire 10,000 American workers-- the disabled, veterans who want to start their own businesses, out of work youth, the unemployed, the underemployed?"
1/30/2017 19:43,You have lost another customer. Shame on you
1/30/2017 19:43,I was never an enthusiastic customer before - but now I am. Thank you Starbucks for standing up for what's right.
1/30/2017 19:43,"What away to put America first!!  Hire 10,000 refugees!  Never will I set foot in any of your stores.. I stand behind my President!!  President Donald Trump!!Ì†ºÌ∑∫Ì†ºÌ∑∏Ì†ºÌ∑∫Ì†ºÌ∑∏Ì†ºÌ∑∫Ì†ºÌ∑∏Ì†ºÌ∑∫Ì†ºÌ∑∏Ì†ºÌ∑∫Ì†ºÌ∑∏"
1/30/2017 19:42,Just lost a lot of customers!
1/30/2017 19:41,"Why would I buy from a company that believes I'm a horrible person? It's awesome that you're hiring refugees; hire whomever you choose, for whatever reason you choose. But you're mischaracterizing Trump's policies; and, *more importantly,* you're making people like me out to be horrible people. Newsflash: not every decent person agrees with how to do the right thing.  Decent people can, and do, disagree on vital issues.

Conservatives have been physically attacked in alarming numbers over the past few months; Conservatives have received death threats in order to be silenced; CNN has said that the torture of the disabled conservative was not evil.

Therefore, people need to hear that decent people can disagree on vital issues.  You can be part of the violence, or part of the solution. I'm okay with Starbucks taking a political stand; but please remember to characterize the opposition as decent humans. We are feeling dehumanized by Liberals, as we are being physically attacked and the media is basically saying it's okay--but mostly the media simply ignores the violence while they talk about us as if we're evil.

I will buy from your competition (instead of from Starbucks), until such time that Starbucks can publicly acknowledge that decent people are allowed to hold different views than you do on these political issues (and make it as public as your announcement about hiring refugees was)."
1/30/2017 19:40,I'm a barista at a licensed location and I'm proud to represent such a remarkable company who cares about people around the world ! What a great company ! Bravo for your remarkable decision!
1/30/2017 19:39,Thank you for supporting immigrants. I'm on my way to get a cup of coffee there. Good work.
1/30/2017 19:39,Thank you for being on the right side of history.  Make America Kind Again
1/30/2017 19:37,"Refugee's OK.  But please do not select a refugee over an American citizen (black, white, yellow, gay, transgender, etc). I hope they can speak english in the stores.  If you want to help refugee's maybe Starbucks needs to help educate them before you give them a job, or sponsor families.  Or is just the CEO voicing his dislike to the President and the 3 month band of letting individuals into this country.  3 months, come on...  I have been and still am a very loyal customer of Starbucks."
1/30/2017 19:36,after your statement to day...I will never buy another product from you...
1/30/2017 19:36,Not supporting Starbucks anymore. I will not give you another dime since I found out where my money is going
1/30/2017 19:36,So your gonna gain 10k new employees but lose hundreds of thousands of customers. Hmm...makes sense!
1/30/2017 19:35,"THANK YOU Starbucks! Your commitment to social justice is amazing. Already a customer, and very proud to be one."
1/30/2017 19:34,"Thank you for your committment to hire refugees, I will be buying more Starbucks and bring my friends"
1/30/2017 19:34,"A question about the recent decision to hire 10,000 refugees: Was this always in the works as part of an effort to help with the needs of displaced persons, or is this more of a political action to express the company's ideals and be an active voice in light of the President's recent executive order? I have no agenda with this question, I simply want to know what the motivation for this announcement is."
1/30/2017 19:33,Thank you so much for supporting American values & committing to hire refugees. I'm headed your way this afternoon - with friends - specifically because of this.
1/30/2017 19:33,"Nice thought about hiring refugees! How about hiring 1000 VETERANS who are looking for jobs , these folks gave their lives so AMERICANS can buy your COFFEE!!!!"
1/30/2017 19:33,Are you also making massive jobs available to homeless American veterans?
1/30/2017 19:27,You said you will hire thousands of refugees! How about hiring American Citizens and Veterans . I have decided that due to your policy I will no longer intend to frequent you stores or buy your products. I am ashamed of you and your lack of patriotism.
1/30/2017 19:24,Why are refugees more important to you all than our veterans?
1/30/2017 19:24,"Thank you, Starbucks, for taking a leadership role in the immigrant/refugee issue! Ì†ΩÌ≤ñ‚òïÔ∏èÌ†ΩÌ±èÌ†ºÌøª"

1/30/2017 19:21,Hey Starbucks- I support you 100%.
1/30/2017 19:21,Thank you for supporting refugees. You've earned my business!
1/30/2017 19:20,"starbucks -if you want to prioritize refugees in other countries that is fine, but how about investing some of that budget in improving the base salaries of all of your baristas in the US? justice fair students baristas"
1/30/2017 19:19,"with your little hiring 10,000 refugees ahead of any actual Americans plan. you will never ever ever receive another single penny from me. at this moment you are on the official boycott list."
1/30/2017 19:18,Thank you Starbucks for supporting the refugees who come to our great land of opportunity by promising to give them dignity through work. Ten thousand jobs for refugees will grow our economy and promote world peace.
1/30/2017 19:17,we as Americans do not owe anyone - anything....especially from another country
1/30/2017 19:16,"I have been a valued customer of Starbucks for over an decade. I visit Starbucks daily spending between $5.00 to $10.00. I go to Starbucks in California, Nevada, Oregon, and throughout other States while traveling Nationwide. Anually I spend upwards of $2,000.00 a year with Starbucks. Over the past decade I have spent over $20,000.00 at Starbucks Stores. With that said I will NOT be purchasing anything ever again from Starbucks. I will be selling ALL of my stock in this company today. I will also  encourage my friends, family, co-workers, and everyone I meet to do the same. I am doing this because of Howard Schultz, Starbuck's Chairman and CEO. His stance on hiring 10,000 refugees over the course of the next five years mainly focused on the United States and our temporary ban of refugees from seven countries where terrorist acts happen on a daily bases. It sadden me to know I will no longer be seeing those friendly faces that I have built friendships over the years by visiting your stores daily. It is very upsetting that Starbucks has taken this stance and I will miss being a VALUED CUSTOMER. I think Starbucks should just stick to being focused on it's customers, stock holders, and coffee rather than being politically involved in our Nations issues. We are all Americans and have taken in more refugees than all other Nations combined since our Nation was founded. I don't think it is a business' job to support hiring of refugees because of it's personal opinion of Nations policies on refugees and keeping American safe from terrorist acts that could be caused by an influx of refugees from war torn counrties. Americans need jobs and Starbucks should follow fair hiring practices without people being looked over for a job as an American citizen for a refugee. I just stopped by Starbucks to tell the Manager and it's employees about my decision to NOT frequent Starbucks anymore. I am also making my way to another Starbucks Store to tell them the same thing. It really bums me out to know Starbucks is more worried about refugees than Americans. I have voiced my opinion to Starbucks Corporation via a phone call this morning as well. I will also encourage all my friends and family on Facebook to STOP doing business with Starbucks as a whole. I hope someone at Starbucks takes the time to reads this and think about the cost to the Company and it's Shareholders due to Howard Schultz, CEO. Thank you for your time.

1/30/2017 19:16,THANK YOU Starbucks
1/30/2017 19:15,"disappointing in starbuc, no live people to speak with all animated @ 800...so i had to email and ask that the balance on the card i hold be refunded. due to the stand on hiring thousands of immigrants i will no longer buy any products there.  our veterans come first you nimrods and don't tell me of your prejudice or dictate to me an proud American..I will only patronize those that honor our citizens first...along with hollyweird, those immoral,sinners are for entertainment only and need to keep their mouths shut...how dare those people tell me...u take the refuges or better yet all you SOB's can leave....."
1/30/2017 19:15,"Dear deplorables:

Take the time to research what programs Starbucks already has for veterans and how they help their spouses for college instead of being useless brainwashed sheeps. Btw, where was your outrage when Republican leaders were cutting bills aimed at helping our veterans?

"
1/30/2017 19:14,"Happy to hear that this company is doing what God would smile upon and supporting the refugees. Now there will be less bigots in your shops, thank you."
1/30/2017 19:14,Thank you for standing up for what is right. We must fight this fascist nonsense.
1/30/2017 19:13,"Thank you for your humanity.

I don't normally go to coffee shops, but I will go to yours. Thank you!"
1/30/2017 19:13,"Thank you, Starbucks for your commitment to hire 10,000 refugees in the next 5 years! I spent my money in your store this morning!"
1/30/2017 19:13,"Thanks, Starbucks, for leading the way and speaking out for justice and the American way, in a language the POTUS can under$tand."
1/30/2017 19:13,"I used to love Starbucks but I stopped going months ago. The lines have been too long, service is subpar and the quality has gone downhill.This refugee hiring has no impact on me going to Starbucks .  One of the other main reasons is Starbucks has raised prices and it's a bit expensive to buy a coffee there. There are plenty of other coffee places where I can get a coffee for less. Starbucks should focus on these things rather than involve themselves in politics."
1/30/2017 19:12,Not one dime will be spent in your stores going forward. America first!
1/30/2017 19:12,Why are refugees more important than US Veterans?
1/30/2017 19:08,"We support what you are doing. Because of the support you will give to refugee's, here is my support to you

1/30/2017 18:59,"Even though that Butterscoth latte I had the other day was either made wrong OR it was just indeed nasty, I stand with Starbucks and their consistent decisions to make the world a better place!"
1/30/2017 18:57,Your CEO just lost my business because of the decisions he made to hire refugees instead of our homeless and veterans. boycottStarbucks
1/30/2017 18:57,Another CEO that doesn't get that America FIRST doesn't mean America ONLY. So I've bought my last Starbucks. Why alienate half you base by taking political stances? I guess it's time to finally try McD's...

1/30/2017 18:49,I dont drink coffee but i am definitely stopping by and seeing what other things you offer. Thank you for standing up for the powerless.
1/30/2017 18:48,"To those boycotting, have you actually read the article?
They aren't firing people, they aren't only hiring immigrants, and they aren't pledging to hire ""illegals"".
Here is what they are doing 
WORLDWIDE!!!  NOT JUST IN THE US!!

Starbucks says it plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years in the 75 countries where it does business.

The refugee hiring proposal, Schultz wrote, will begin with a focus on people who have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel.

Please read the article and understand what is really happening."
1/30/2017 18:47,Purchasing Starbucks twice today to show my support.  :)
1/30/2017 18:45,Wouldn't spend one penny at this company!
1/30/2017 18:44,"Starbucks , it's sad and honestly quite humorous that y'all are now using politics to not only gain in your financial needs but also in your reputation as ""lending a helping hand"". Would have been a really commendable act if you didn't have to go public with it and sought attention through the suffering of others. There are a lot more than 10,000 refugees. It's called being humble something it seems y'all might have forgotten about. Don't get me wrong y'all coffee is fire Ì†ΩÌ±åÌ†ºÌøº"
1/30/2017 18:43,"Goodbye Starbucks. Apparently your loyal long term customers are less important to you than tour politics. 
I've been a customer since 1994, only place I used to get coffee. I'll find a new place and ensure my friends and family do the same."
1/30/2017 18:42,"Bye, Starbucks. My bucks are going elsewhere. You screwed the pooch."
1/30/2017 18:41,"I'm confused with Starbucks discriminating policy, for it only causes more and more hatred for innocent people trying to fit-in. Most of these people (refugees) only want to better their families lives, not be used or abused by a Liberal or Republican agenda; it shows the true colors of abuse! All Americans should be allowed to apply and work at Starbucks; vets, refugees,, all Americans! His comments are discriminating against all others, and truly causes a firestorm of anger for innocent people escaping their own nightmares; I assure you, 1000's of lawsuits are about to befall on Starbucks, and its CEO's comments will become the preponderance of that evidence. Two bad policies doesn't help this bad situation;  it only serves to make it worse."
1/30/2017 18:40,"I knew the hate and vitriol would start the minute I read the articles about Starbucks agreeing to hire 10,000 refugees.  For you 'Murica first people, Starbucks has hired a shitload (sorry about the language SB) of US veterans over the years.  Their CEO's progressive leanings have been known for years.  If this is what tipped you over the edge, you haven't been paying attention.  I will be drinking nothing but Starbucks from now on if for no other reason than the compassion they have shown both for our veterans and our fellow human beings"
1/30/2017 18:38,"Two thumbs up for Starbucks. At this time when our very core values are being overturned, it's important that everyone with a voice should speak out, and everyone with the means to do so, should take action."
1/30/2017 18:30,America first!!
1/30/2017 18:27,"Starbucks CEO counters Trump's travel ban with vow to hire 10,000 refugees

1/30/2017 18:26,"Just read that the CEO of Starbucks is pledging to hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years in response to Donald Trump's immigration ban. So how do U.S citizens looking for work feel about this?"
1/30/2017 18:25,Ok starbucks.. why not have an African American program to help the high unemployment rate for actual AMERICANS... LOST MY BUSINESS
1/30/2017 18:24,"So tell us, Mr. Generosity, why not hire 10,000 homeless/jobless veterans?"
1/30/2017 18:23,"Hiring of 10,000 refugees is all wrong. Will never by any of your products again."

1/30/2017 18:17,"Your business is only as strong as the American people allow it to be. If you are not behind President Donald Trump, then you are not behind the American people. Apologize and Recant your statement to the American people."
1/30/2017 18:15,Thank you for your commitment to help refugees and immigrants. Thank you for continuing to help veterans and those who served our country. Thank you for helping put students through college and hiring them.
1/30/2017 18:15,My family and I will no longer be customers of Starbucks. You have put refugees before Americans. You are discriminating against your own countrymen and women who need jobs.
1/30/2017 18:15,"Hello Mr. Starbucks CEO, I have been a customer of Starbucks for 8 plus years until today.................I spend approx. 3-400 dollars per month with your firm...............If you do not support our President and the United States of America security I cannot in good faith support your firm................It will be nice to see your stock head south...........Good Day"

1/30/2017 18:12,I will no longer buy anything starbucks. You have lost all of mt families business forever because of your retaliation against our president.
1/30/2017 18:09,"Starbucks just lost my business. I will now shop with one of the local coffee houses. So will the bulk of my family. Starbucks is placing this nation at risk by vowing to hire 10,00 people who may or may not be here for the wrong reasons. The terrorists slip in to this country by posing as refugees!!! We do not reward bad behavior"
1/30/2017 18:09,THANK YOU for your ongoing commitment to your program of hiring veterans at home AND now refugees in the 75 countries you are in around the world! Way to go Starbucks!!! (Now I will have to find something other than my beloved Chai Tea Latte to give up for Lent.)
1/30/2017 18:09,What a sad day when you take the stand to hire that many immigrants yet never an offer such to our vets or out of work citizens. You've lost my business.
1/30/2017 18:08,"Oh Well, there goes the stock price! Prison next for the CEO et al. Ha ha"
1/30/2017 18:07,Congrats for taking a stand for immigrants and against Trump's latest immigration plans. Customer for life.
1/30/2017 18:05,"How about hiring the person who best fits the job description and who is in the country legal, regardless or sex, race, religion or nationallity? Is this what Starbucks is doing? NO! Otherwise, there would be no need for such an announcement."
1/30/2017 18:05,"Thank you for the compassionate pledge to hire 10,000 refugees around the world."
1/30/2017 17:59,"Do NOT back down!  Only 18% of Americans voted for Trump!  Their boycott will not last.  We support you!!  And in fact, I will start buying more coffee from Starbucks!  <3"
1/30/2017 17:58,"Thank you, Starbucks, for supporting refugees. Living out American values is patriotism. I'm going out to buy some today!"
1/30/2017 17:57,"So you plan on hiring 10,000 refuges here in America, good and let those 10,000 refuges be your loyal customers, because I am not spending another penny on your products"
1/30/2017 17:56,For every comment against Starbucks I will be donating to the Syrian refugee fund in the commenters name.
1/30/2017 17:55,"Starbucks I just recently returned to your coffee shop. No more in direct response to your treasonous behavior towards the President of the United States. I herby declare that I will never do any business with you, your franchises, other holdings, partners and your venders. Good by forever Starbucks, You Suck !!!"
1/30/2017 17:51,THANKS FOR SUPPORTING REFUGEE HIRING!  There are 3Million more of us who believe you are doing the right thing...and I sincerely doubt the 70% of uneducated white men are purchasing coffee at Starbucks!!
1/30/2017 17:49,Moving to Dunkin Dounuts for my coffee.  Never mix politics with business.
1/30/2017 17:48,"hey starbucks, i hope the refugees you're going to employ can afford your coffee, because i for one would much rather visit a coffee shop that hires based on quality of staff as opposed to trying to fill a political agenda."
1/30/2017 17:47,"My daughter, a 2016 valedictorian at Littlerock High School in the Antelope Valley CA, applied for a job at Starbucks in Palmdale and did not even get a phone call.  However, SJW Starbucks CEO plans to hire 1000 refugees.  I plan to NEVER enter a Starbucks again as long as I live.

Maybe this is where I should post my photo of a Starbucks store, shot from within a another Starbucks store in Calabasas CA.  I will look for mom-and-pop stores from now on."
1/30/2017 17:47,I got beef with you guys lol no birthday drink in my starbucks app this year? damnnnn.
1/30/2017 17:46,I boycott Starbucks because the coffee is terrible!
1/30/2017 17:45,"Instead of refugees,  why not make a commitment to hiring 10,000 veterans,  since they are more likely to be your customers.  You male your millions off of Americans but then don't want to hire them. Well,  now you have one less customer.  dunkindonutsitis"
1/30/2017 17:45,"I live in Brazil and would like to congratulate Mr. Howard Schultz on his initiative in the face of the President of the United States's position against refugee immigration. I live in a city of 500,000 that does not have starbucks, but if there is interest, I am willing to invest in a Starbucks on my city and hire refugee people."
1/30/2017 17:44,"Since you are committed to hiring refuges I will no longer buy your coffee, neither will anyone of my family or friends,"
1/30/2017 17:44,"A coffee company inserting itself into politics. Why? Publicity? Like Starbucks isn't a huge brand name? I ignored the commentary during the election but now you're going too far. You're willing to hire refugees versus out of work citizens or students trying to just barely make it? I'm just one citizen, but I will not purchase your products any longer. There's plenty of other choices for coffee."
1/30/2017 17:42,Boycott Starbucks!  Giving preference to refugees over Americans...
1/30/2017 17:42,"I was appalled and sickened by the announcement that Starbucks would hire 10,000 refugees in defiance of Trumps ban on immigration. It's not that I'm against immigration it's that I'm against giving 10,000 refugees preference over those in our own country that would give their left arm for a job, some of which probably have, namely veterans. How many veterans are without jobs, how many unemployed would die for a job, how many homeless do we have out there because they don't have a job. Shame on you Starbucks. I have never been a patron of Starbucks and I never will after this."
1/30/2017 17:41,Yet another reason to not drink what you call coffee.
1/30/2017 17:39,Hire whomever you like. I will buy my coffee products elsewhere.
1/30/2017 17:38,"If you are really hiring all those refugees, I will no longer patronize you. I am a daily customer. Over US citizens? Hope you have a lot refugees who can buy your coffee. BOYCOTT Starbucks."
1/30/2017 17:34,Hire Americans out of work instead of refugees
1/30/2017 17:33,"Starbucks, choosing to hire a certain amount of a certain people group (non citizens) is reverse discrimination and against affirmative action. It is not supporting true Americans or America 1st. I do not support you and will be boycottingstarbucks by not purchasing from your stores. -An American"
1/30/2017 17:33,Where are these 10.0000 jobs coming from? Are we replacing American workers? Why can't you pledge to support our veterans? Guess it's time for me to find another coffee outlet!
1/30/2017 17:33,"Hey Starbucks: How about opening a couple of franchises in Aleppo? Then you could hire all the illiterate, murderous woman-raping, gay-hating, goat-loving degenerates you want.

1/30/2017 17:28,Do you have any plans or current programs  assist veterans get hired in your establishments.
1/30/2017 17:28,"As a 3rd generation immigrant from Syria and Germany (pre WWII), getting a handle on who in the immigrant community are terrorists is a small price to pay considering the damages they are doing.

1/30/2017 17:24,"I support Starbucks decision to employee 10,000 refugees!"
1/30/2017 17:24,"You'll never see another dime from me. There are thousands of veterans out of work, not to mention American  (born or naturalized) citizens that don't have jobs. Making a declaration to what you think is popular doesn't make you right."
1/30/2017 17:22,"Thank you, Starbucks, for your stand on hiring immigrants, as well as your other socially conscientious stands."
1/30/2017 17:21,"Come on guys!! I'm not gonna lie, I love Starbucks but youre making it hard to stop by for my cuppa! How about hiring 10,000 Americans who need a job, there's a homeless problem you could help with, how about helping our veterans in some way. America is your home, right???"
1/30/2017 17:19,"I use to be a long time Starbucks customer, $25+ a week, but now? Never again!"
1/30/2017 17:16,You are a disgrace to this country. You could give jobs to the people that have fought for you freedom but no you decide to announce you are going to give jobs to illegal immigrants. Your company will fail and I will be glad when you shut your doors and go bankrupt.
1/30/2017 17:16,"Outrageous to hire people only b/c they are ""refugees"" - my son has been applying to SB for years, not hired - a honor's student. I am a Democrat my whole life but this is such an obvious PR move and so distasteful."

1/30/2017 17:14,"Will you be vetting the new 10,000 employees you plan on hiring?  Criminal record, drug use, credit history.  If not good for you.  If so you are doing exactly what the US is requiring for entry to this country."
1/30/2017 17:13,"Instead of pledging to hire Syrian refugees, why not pledge to hire American Veterans?"
1/30/2017 17:12,"Strbcs was always too expensive , but spending  money for political correct statements  is not my way . you may be cool for the ""refgees welcome"" generation, until they get victomised like we europeans get every day. here they are called rapefugees by German women.  I would not enjoy the coffee. bye, bye from germany."
1/30/2017 17:10,"Thank you, Starbucks! I will increase my patronage and tell all my friends to do the same. Refugees are important human beings who have been through hell, and I can't believe how mean-spirited someone would have to be to boycott your company because you want to hire them. I look forward to my next cup of tea at Starbucks."
1/30/2017 17:07,Disappointing to hear about your involvement in this political disarray of activity. Maybe it's time to make our own coffee!
1/30/2017 17:06,"I love my coffee but I will never be a patron of Starbucks again. You can committ to 10,000 jobs to refugees but can not committ to employing homeless veterans? Your priorities are a mess. I will spend my money elsewhere and I will make sure that my friends do the same."

1/30/2017 16:41,"Used to shop at Starbucks every now and then, will go out of my way to be there 100% of the time now! Thank you for standing up and acting like a real American - a true Patriot. Sad that those negative voices cannot remember how they got to America - easy to forget and easier to take for granted."
1/30/2017 16:40,Will no longer be buying Starbucks products due to decision to hire double the number of refugees as before.
1/30/2017 16:40,Dear Starbucks - Thank you for putting compassion ahead of money. I and my family will now be buying our coffees and hot chocolates at Starbucks. Please don't let the haters sway you! Go Starbucks!
1/30/2017 16:40,"10,000 refugees you will hire? How many homeless and Vets have you hired???  Not 10,0000!!  You suck..  BOYCOTT!!!!!"
1/30/2017 16:38,"We currently have 50,000 homeless veterans here in America.
I'm not one to boycott a company because of their beliefs. However, this is the straw that broke the camel's back. I get that Starbucks is a liberal company. But, to prioritize illegals over AMERICANS is just pitiful. Looks like it is Dunkin Donuts for me from now on."
1/30/2017 16:38,So many hate filled people posting on here today. A refugee is not taking your job or a vets job. Grow up.
1/30/2017 16:37,So Starbucks vows to hire 10000 refugees? That may be fine but how about hiring 10000 America citizens first? I will never again buy anything from Starbucks.
1/30/2017 16:35,How do I get a refund off money loaded to my card?
1/30/2017 16:33,"Look at all these butthurt, triggered snowflake Trump supporters. It sounds like they all need safe spaces. Ì†ΩÌ∏¢"
1/30/2017 16:33,"You wanna hire Refugees??? What about our Homeless Veterans???? You started having your Military spouse employees wear green aprons stating they are a Military spouse. Like Starbucks is so proud. Where is your hiring of 10,000 homeless Veterans campaign??? What about those people Starbucks?"
1/30/2017 16:33,"Until I here an explanation about the hiring of refugees,I will not go to starbucks AGAIN!!"
1/30/2017 16:32,God bless your stance. You have my support.
1/30/2017 16:31,"You want to inspire and nurture the human spirit? How about offering jobs to the 50,000 homeless American military veterans instead of trying to give them to illegal immigrants! You are a shameful and disrespectful corporation and my family will never spend one more hard earned American dollar in one of your establishments. Good day."
1/30/2017 16:31,"Thank you Howard Schultz for your commitment to hire 10,000 refugees and for standing up for our Democracy! You have just gained a loyal customer!
sipsomelove ‚ù§"
1/30/2017 16:30,"Starbucks,will continue to not support your chain nor buy any of your coffee.  Why not try to brew a pot of Italian or French roast in the afternoons for your customers when out of your specialty coffees when someone asks for it in the afternoon rather than offer your weak acidic Pikes Place nasty coffee or hire refugees.  Just another progressive company taking a socialistic political stance.  Why not train your baristas to make a consistent cup of coffee rather drinks that a milky sweet hot mess.  Why not lower your prices to help fight homeless children or give your money to cancer patients.  Instead of helping others overseas why not start here in the USA.  America First."
1/30/2017 16:30,Boycotting!!!  Why are you hiring immigrants when we have homeless here??? Wow I'm done Ì†ΩÌ∏†
1/30/2017 16:29,"You just lost a lifelong customer. Go hire your 10,000 refugees while you ignore the 50,000 veterans who are homeless"
1/30/2017 16:28,"Why would you want to hire 10,000 refugees in the next five years instead of vets or everyday Americans who need jobs?!"
1/30/2017 16:24,"LOVE LOVE LOVE the Chai Tea Latte!  BUT please, hire vets, single parents, and such...give them the preferential treatment first, as Americans...and should a person enter our country legally and become American, then maybe...
Just my thoughts...."
1/30/2017 16:23,Good for your CEO.  Now he can feel all important and altruistic as he looks down from his ivory tower.
1/30/2017 16:22,Please close your store located in Trump Tower first!
1/30/2017 16:22,"How about instead of hiring a bunch of refugees,  you start being AMERICANS and hire someone that's served for our country !!! VETS NEED JOBS !!!!!"
1/30/2017 16:21,"Just read the CEO's announcement on hiring 10,000 refugees. If they are fully vetted and enter legally, great. If this is a liberal ploy which being based in WA I fully expect then he's lost my business and I will encourage every one of my friends to take their food dollar elsewhere. Caribou Coffee comes to mind as does Peet's."
1/30/2017 16:20,Never again.....  America First!
1/30/2017 16:19,"I guess America does not have enough Vets who served to protect this country, homeless, and people on Welfare who need jobs first?!???    
What a shame to be a part of the problem and not the solution to protect America first!!!

1/30/2017 16:18,So Starbucks is hiring thousands of refugees in the next few years??? What about the American citizens that have no jobs!!!!
1/30/2017 16:17,Supporting Starbucks commitment to hire refugees. Will commit to a coffee a day.
1/30/2017 16:17,"I have a bit of cash left on my gold card. Does anyone know if you can cash it out? I refuse to support a company who does not support fellow Americans.  You're going to put American teens out of work, when you have the opportunity to employ them, and keep them off the street. I keep hearing bold move. More like stupid. While I'm sure you won't go out of business,  I'm hoping you at least feel the wrath of the American people."
1/30/2017 16:17,Thank you for standing up for the refugees! I will buy more from starbucks in the future !!!
1/30/2017 16:15,Never again will I give $1 to Starbucks- The CEO is a disgrace
1/30/2017 16:14,"Boycotting Starbucks- Drop a line to CEO Executive Officer Howard Schultz letting him know people all over are not going to tolerate the hiring of 10,000 refugees. Really- American citizens need work."
1/30/2017 16:14,Don't you think you should hire American people first rather then a bunch of bombers plus you guys are way to expensive anyway
1/30/2017 16:13,The left were just about to pounce. That is until his name was discovered to be Mohamed.
1/30/2017 16:13,OMG i wish Starbucks CEO would just quit talking. Now i have to move to Coffee Bean & Tea.
1/30/2017 16:12,I will never walk in your store again.  Americans need to hire AMERICANS
1/30/2017 16:10,"Your going to hire 10,000 refugees!!!! How about hiring 10,000 homeless people to give them a new start. How about hiring 10,000 inner city kids to help lift them out of poverty. My family and I will no longer buy any of your coffee or any products that you sell."
1/30/2017 16:08,"I don't like coffee, but I am going to buy it daily at Starbucks which is my ""local"" coffee shop."
1/30/2017 16:07,I just want to say this company really goes above and beyond when it comes to making a small issue really seem like nothing at all. Their customer service agent handled the situation above my expectations and to me that is the extra mile that keeps a very loyal customer. Keep up the great work!!!!!!!!!
1/30/2017 16:06,I don't buy your over priced crap so at least my $ are not helping to fund planned parent hood.
1/30/2017 16:06,You make me sick I'll NEVER buy anything from you again..... MAKING AMERICA GREAT
1/30/2017 16:06,"You will NEVER receive one red cent from me or my family ever again. Instead of playing partisan politics, try giving jobs to our Veterans instead."
1/30/2017 16:05,"By defying President Trump's temporarily halting incoming refugees, you show yourself as anti-USA. You just lost any and all of my business. President Trump's program of extreme vetting is to keep this country AND YOUR COFFEE SHOPS SAFE!! Apparently you don't seem concerned about a terrorist attack in your outlets and your customers that may be killed."
1/30/2017 16:05,Will never purchase your products again....period
1/30/2017 16:04,You suck veterans first hope you.go broke
1/30/2017 16:03,"How about hiring 10,000 homeless American Veterans ..."
1/30/2017 16:02,"I'd like to say that i am a very faithful customer of Starbucks.  So faithful in fact that I noticed the change in the lids a few months ago.  I have tried to adjust but I cannot.  I'm sure that there is a very valid reason for the change in manufacturer or material but my issue is with the shape.  It has changed slightly and every time I take a sip of my latte delisiousness I seem to drip.  On my finger, on my clothes, on my seatbelt. It is driving me insane.  Please fix the  hot beverage lids!!!"
1/30/2017 16:01,Thank you for standing up.
1/30/2017 16:00,Never again Starbucks!
1/30/2017 15:59,"How about to hire our veterans and Christian's, thanks God  i never had any of you coffe. MAGA"
1/30/2017 15:59,"""Hiring would apply to stores worldwide and the effort would start in the United States where the focus would be on hiring immigrants ‚Äúwho have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel.""

-not just in the USA, but around the world.

-Muslims are not the only refugees out there."
1/30/2017 15:59,"You're not to big to fail. Hiring 10,000 refugees. How about 10,000 homeless people? 10,000  vets? 10,000 US citizens? Oh thats right...progressive doctrine follower. You know metro area may keep you in business locally...but elsewhere...center of the country...you're going to loose some business my boy."
1/30/2017 15:58,"After your 10,000 refugee comment showing us the citizens of America that you don't care for us and our unemployed citizens you have lost my business.  PERIOD. Sadly I won't miss much because the inconsistency of product quality is just beyond words to describe.  When I have to tell a barista how to make the frapp Pok√©mon Go, weeks after it's release. Well what am I paying for. The consistency has been so bad that when they do get it right I tip 20$ as positive reinforcement.  I've tipped that much twice in 6 months. I'll miss the Radom flavorful drink.  And I'll really miss buying your overpriced venti sippy cups to which I have 18, but other than that. I'm putting America first. Bye"

1/30/2017 15:56,"Booo to you Starbucks! How about you sign up with work one and hire some unemployed Americans! There are plenty of Veterans that need jobs. Non violent excons have a horrible time getting hired, they all still need to take care of themselves and their families. You should be ashamed of yourselves for doing this because your CEO'S/owners/whomevers do not like our POTUS. Shameful"
1/30/2017 15:55,"Dear Sir,

I have been a Starbucks gold card holder for many years and I have some questions about Starbucks corporate policy.

In 2013, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced that the world‚Äôs biggest coffee chain would commit to hiring at least 10,000 veterans and spouses of active military in five years.

Yesterday, Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz said Sunday the company plans to hire 10,000 refugees in its stores worldwide over the next five years.

Obviously, it is very unlikely Starbucks can fulfill both promises. It appears Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has reneged on his first promise to U.S. veterans and spouses in that Starbucks priority in hiring is no longer U.S. Veterans and spouses but now Starbucks priority is hiring refugees.

Please clarify Starbuck‚Äôs decisions on Veterans verses refugees. Who is Starbucks priority in hiring?

Thank you,

Douglas Bohannon"
1/30/2017 15:54,"Starbucks isn't worried about losing the gas station customer, who causally buys their coffee. I'm sorry, only educated and fundamentally sound people can afford Starbucks every day. Your support will not be missed."
1/30/2017 15:54,Another reason to not go there.
1/30/2017 15:54,"Very discouraged that you would prioritize the hiring of 10,000 refugees over offering those same jobs to our own American service men and women! There many people in our own country who need jobs to put food on the table for their kids! I feel you have stepped onto dangerous ground inserting yourself into this political controversy. What happened to just serving coffee and leaving politics to the American people? I guess big business does like to insert itself into the political fray, doesn't it?"
1/30/2017 15:49,"""Hiring would apply to stores worldwide and the effort would start in the United States where the focus would be on hiring immigrants ‚Äúwho have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel.""

-not just in the USA, but around the world.

-Muslims are not the only refugees out there."
1/30/2017 15:47,Bye bye Starbucks I am a disabled veteran there are so many of us who are struggling for a job and you are going to hire refugees you should ashamed of yourselves veterans sacrificed so much so you can have your freedoms your pathetic you will lose business over this my self and thousands of other veterans will not continue to spend money in a place that dishonors every veteran in this country. Hope it was worth it because you betrayed us
1/30/2017 15:47,You lost me as a customer! Hire refugees??
1/30/2017 15:47,"Since Starbucks plans to hire 10,000 refugees over the next 5 years, what percentage of their overall workforce does that represent? Does this mean that 10,000 USA citizens are out of a job?"
1/30/2017 15:46,"""Hiring would apply to stores worldwide and the effort would start in the United States where the focus would be on hiring immigrants ‚Äúwho have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel.""

1/30/2017 15:43,History is your friend.  Politics is not your friend.  Choose your battle wisely.
1/30/2017 15:42,"So Starbucks, you will have 10,000 job openings that you could give to our veterans and US citizens, but you are going to give them to immigrants!  Says a lot about you doesn't it!  Well maybe everyone should stop going to Starbucks!  That would be our way of expressing our freedom and love for our country, and love for those who fought and who fight for that freedom!"
1/30/2017 15:42,"THANK YOU Starbucks for 10,000 refugee jobs, for supporting our democracy and for serving humanity. Thank you for knowing who you are and what you stand for. Getting an extra order of my favorite vent mocha today :)"
1/30/2017 15:41,YUMMM  every reason in the world to grab a Frappuccino today!!!
1/30/2017 15:40,"Wanna hire refugees, go against the presidents orders. Then my family will no longer have Starbucks. Good day."
1/30/2017 15:38,Thank you for loving humanity!  <3
1/30/2017 15:38,"It is such a wonderful thing you are doing, hiring refugees. I love your coffee and now I love you Starbucks. Such a caring and compassionate effort to make this country a more beautiful place in such hateful times."
1/30/2017 15:36,Community Coffee is better!
1/30/2017 15:36,"Thank you, for supporting immigrants; I am proud to be a Starbucks customer."
1/30/2017 15:34,"Thank you for pledging to hire 10,000 refugees. I will be more likely than ever to support Starbucks."
1/30/2017 15:34,Thank you for your promise to hire refugees! Thank you for caring about people all over the world and not just the US! Thank you for caring for those seeking refuge! supportstarbucks
1/30/2017 15:33,I had to unlike this page because starbucks is simply unamerican
1/30/2017 15:33,"I usually spend nearly a hundred dollars a month on Coffee from Starbucks. it will go to McDonalds or some other place on my trip in to work from now on. 
looks like it will be the same for most of my friends and family. Way to go America! i'm Proud of you!"
1/30/2017 15:31,"We are wondering if Starbucks had 10,000 jobs why they have not been made available to veterans , homeless and local staffing companies.?????? We just wonder who financed these 10,000 jobs all off a sudden????? Over-rated over-priced product"
1/30/2017 15:31,"According to the draft copy of Trump‚Äôs executive order, the countries whose citizens are barred entirely from entering the United States is based on a bill that Obama signed into law in December 2015.Obama signed the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act as part of an omnibus spending bill. The legislation restricted access to the Visa Waiver Program, which allows citizens from 38 countries who are visiting the United States for less than 90 days to enter without a visa."
1/30/2017 15:31,"You seriously want to support illegals , refugees ? And not support the Americans specifically veterans who defend your country and keep you safe as well as your freedoms / and out of work families , but rather employ the one thing that's draining us ? And creating havoc on the infrastructure of this country . The moment you walk away and abandon your country is the moment you lose my families business and many more who will boycott you ."
1/30/2017 15:30,"I don't look down on anyone trying to better themselves, but the CEO says he is going to hire 10,000 Muslim to spite President Trump. Why??? Can ppl just stop hating each other long enough to try and make this a better place?? EVERYONE deserves a job no matter what country you are born in."
1/30/2017 15:30,Shame on you.   No more Starbucks for me!
1/30/2017 15:29,"I understand you are going to hire illegals over American people.  I hope this is not true. Or I'll  have to no longer visit you, as well as, you have been my favorite for gift cards.  Well, McDonald's sells coffee cheaper.. GOOD bye"
1/30/2017 15:26,"When Starbucks executives start reading Presidential orders, and then keep their political opinions to themselves, I will possibly support them again.  In the meantime, I think I'll use my rewards to get some free stuff, then boycott them."
1/30/2017 15:25,Way to go America. Send a strong and clear message to Starbucks CEO. Americans First!!!
1/30/2017 15:24,"""Hiring would apply to stores worldwide and the effort would start in the United States where the focus would be on hiring immigrants ‚Äúwho have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel.""

1/30/2017 15:23,"Amazing! So happy to hear the decision to hire refugees! I normally do not go to Starbucks, but now it will be my first choice! Good job Starbucks!"
1/30/2017 15:23,"To the CEO. in response to your vow to employ one hundred thousand refugees in response to President Trumps temporary ban on non vetted immigrants. Where were you when President Obama did the exact same thing back in 2011? in fact, and you can check this. it is that very Exact ban that president Trump is ""re enacting."" you hypocrite! I and several dozen of my friends and family have been loyal Starbucks customers. but we will find someone else to buy coffee from now! and those friends will influence their friends and so on.. and the same with my church whose numbers into the 500s will also find another conveyer of coffee. also my Daugher and several of her friends will be giving their notice today, to make way for your,, non American loyalties I will also be destroying all my Starbucks cups, mugs, tree ornaments, and anything else starbucks. Bye Bye guys. we choose America!"
1/30/2017 15:23,Hire Americans!
1/30/2017 15:21,No more star bucks for me ... I'm done
1/30/2017 15:21,Stay out of politics!‚òïÔ∏è
1/30/2017 15:19,"How about hiring some Vets! (updated below)

seems like they do have a vet hiring initiative - started several years ago to hire 10k vets by 2018 - sadly this has not made the news like the refugee initiative has - would be a good thing to do since the divide is growing in our country - still don't like starbucks but i am happy to see them supporting veterans and refugees"
1/30/2017 15:19,National Croissant Day!!!Are you celebrating?
1/30/2017 15:18,Shame on y'all!!!!!!!!.. I Will NEVER ever purchase anything from y'all!!! Why don't y'all just locate to these countries y'all support since u won't support the actual ones who fight to keep u FREE..y'all r a disgrace to AMERICA. Ì†ΩÌ∏°Ì†ΩÌ∏°Ì†ΩÌ∏°

1/30/2017 15:15,Why not hire American?  Why not hire vets??  Just proves Starbucks hates America!  Time to Boycott Starbucks!!  Hire American!!
1/30/2017 15:15,"Thank you, Starbucks, for continuing to celebrate and honor the diversity of all people! I am proud to be your customer!"
1/30/2017 15:15,"Instead of hiring 10,000 refugees...why don't you hire 10,000 homeless veterans and do something for Americans?..."
1/30/2017 15:15,Last straw ..I will NEVER BUY any of your products AGAIN.. it was bad enough with the military COFFEE scandal!
1/30/2017 15:14,"When hiring 10,000 refugees, could you aid them in becoming US citizens so they can vote."
1/30/2017 15:03,"I have a question. Why is Starbucks all of a sudden willing to hire 10,000 refugees, but not willing to hire 10,000 Americans??? Disciminate much???"
1/30/2017 15:03,Just so you know. I will no longer frequent Starbucks. It's Dutch Brothers for me from here on out. Any company that makes money on America and doesn't support it will not be on my list of go to places. There will be many more like me
1/30/2017 15:02,Boycotts don't work. Starbucks will grow even bigger. Good. I'm at one now. Enjoying my hazelnut latte. Place is packed.
1/30/2017 15:01,"No that one person will matter to you but after the statements going against  our President, I for one will no longer do business with you and I will attempt to talk everyone I know into following suit. Go ahead and hire refugees."
1/30/2017 15:00,So many people are triggered and upset about the Starbucks announcement. Do they need safe spaces?
1/30/2017 14:59,"While a noble gesture at face value, this pledge to hire immigrants is affront when considering that is over US citizens of every walk of life, and particularly veterans.
I'm finished with you and will take my money elsewhere."
1/30/2017 14:55,"Starbucks, you have an inferior product that is way overpriced. I guess it makes you feel like now you are playing with the big boy! Go ahead and hire them, let me know how it goes when one of them puts a bullet through your other employees or one of your customers. BOYCOTT STARBUCKS until they learn to be true Americans and support our President Trump."
1/30/2017 14:53,"Puppets!  Puppets leftover from the Odummer administration.    How unpatriotic of you!   
Not one dime from myself or my little franchise EVER again."
1/30/2017 14:49,"Still alienating your customers. Keep it up ! Hopefully, you'll be out of business soon."
1/30/2017 14:43,"I'm glad I support you everyday, multiple times a day. You are a fantastic company. Thank you!"
1/30/2017 14:43,President Trump needs to replace Starbucks with another coffee shop who cares more about profit than politics.
1/30/2017 14:41,Unliked your page and removed your app from my phone . AmericaFirst
1/30/2017 14:38,Starbucks Coffee is Garbage!!
1/30/2017 14:37,Nothing says America company like hiring illegals. Good work Starbucks.
1/30/2017 14:36,"Thank you,  Starbbucks! I've been a patron for years and love your coffee.  Now I'm in love with your stance on hiring refugees!"

1/30/2017 14:35,"Sorry Starbucks, but how many times have you been warned. STAY OUT OF POLITICS!  Not everyone supports your views. BOYCOTT is in order."
1/30/2017 14:33,No more Starbucks for me!  I support keeping terrorist out of USA.
1/30/2017 14:32,"BOYCOTTING STARBUCKS!
Here is why, they don't say they will hire vets, disabled, Seniors or ANY un-employed Americans. There are other coffee shops where the cost is lower and the pastry fresher. Goodbye!

WASHINGTON ‚Äì  Starbucks says it will hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years, a response to President Donald Trump's indefinite suspension of Syrian refugees and temporary travel bans that apply to six other Muslim-majority nations."
1/30/2017 14:31,"How about make the commitment to our veterans and fellow citizens that are in need of a job instead of 10,000 refugees?"
1/30/2017 14:31,Never buying starbucks again. Plenty of homeless veterans homeless mothers that need jobs first. Disgusting. Shameful.
1/30/2017 14:30,How about you hire some vets! You will no longer have my buisness! StarbucksDoesNotSupportVeterans
1/30/2017 14:30,Dear Starbucks.....I nor my family will ever waste our money at your stores again. You are a disgrace to this nation.

What a Putz!"

1/30/2017 13:49,"Mr. Schultz - your statement was as ignorant as the paid protesting snowflakes at the airports. It‚Äôs not a ban, it‚Äôs not letting people into this country from terrorist hotbeds until we figure out who they are and until we secure our borders. No one other than a citizen returning from abroad has a RIGHT to come here. We are a sovereign nation with the right to keep ourselves safe. Your political rhetoric has made me reconsider where I spend my money. Gotta have a WaWa...or Dunkin'"

You are soon to be history!"

1/30/2017 13:27,"I have always been a fan of the social involvement that Starbucks has...including the statements on your cups...and the newest one to hire refugees. My question is: what is the underlying conviction for this involvement? I do a lot of reading in ethics, and so have my opinions...but I would like to hear what you are thinking. Thanks."
1/30/2017 13:27,"Starbucks-why not hire 10,000 Americans before refugees?  Americans need jobs first....
Been a faithful supporter of Starbucks since day one in Seattle....Please do not disappoint me with these ridiculous comments + Hire Americans first!"
1/30/2017 13:26,"So now they're hiring refugees.
I guess we don't have enough unemployed Americans who can work for StarBucks, and God forbid they hire any Veterans in any of those positions.  

I will never buy their products again."
1/30/2017 13:25,I will never buy starbucks again.
1/30/2017 13:23,How bout hiring some vets?
1/30/2017 13:22,I deleted your app and cut my card in half. I'll spend my coffee money elsewhere.
1/30/2017 13:21,Why dont you hire some vets too?
1/30/2017 13:21,"Dear Starbucks, Hiring 10k refugees...cool! I stand firm in believing if I own a business I have the right to run my business my way. 
However, on this particular case I have to wonder, are you building more stores, or are you randomly laying off current non refugee employees? Are you exempt from discrimination laws? I realize this affects more countries other than just America but I assume other countries have some sort of discrimination laws. But let's get back to my country, the United States, do you consciously make an effort to hire our Military Vets? The men and women who give up so much to protect your right to hire refugees. What about Single Parents who could definitely use a helping hand raising our future world leaders? Are they on your list to purposely hire? Last but surely not least, how about our senior adults who are trying to survive on their SS check? You know, your grandparents?
Please don't think my heart doesn't break for so many of these refugees because it does. But I was raised to believe you take care of your own first.  Hopefully I'm misinformed, and you do put our vets, single parents and senior citizens as a priority. If this is the case I encourage you to correct me.

1/30/2017 13:18,"Don't be hiring any refugees! Don't you think we have enough vets and other American citizens without work?! Pathetic!!!

1/30/2017 13:17,"how about instead of hiring 10,000 refugees you hire 10,000 vets! Maybe actually contribute to your country. Until then another Penny of my money will not be spent at Starbucks."
1/30/2017 13:16,BOYCOTT Starbucks! Hire our homeless VETS FIRST!
1/30/2017 13:14,Why don't you commit to hiring our homeless and/or unemployed vets right here right now?  Why not commit to hiring non-vet unemployed and homeless here in the US?  Our vets fought to allow you the freedom to conduct your business and you slap them in the face while committing to hire people who have come here illegally?  Our vets and our homeless need us and instead you make a play for media attention and slap all of them in the face.
1/30/2017 13:13,"Why don't you hire homeless Americans or veterans or wounded warriors?  Hypocrites.  OH wait, you can charge $4/coffiee and pay an illegal $1.50/hr so it works out good for you."

1/30/2017 12:47,starbucks watch your sales go down  when you start hiring refugees over Americans and i know you said you will hire americans who served in the armed forces first but to consider illegal refugees at all is a disgrace
1/30/2017 12:43,"Never buy coffee here again !!!!! 
Hire refugees not Americans who need jobs for their American dream Ì†ΩÌ≤Ø"
1/30/2017 12:42,I see on the news that Starbucks plans to hire thousands of refugees. Do you also plan on hiring thousands of American soldiers that live homeless in our streets that fought for you or thousands of American homeless women that live on our streets? As galant as your company thinks you are being you have just stated that noncitizen are more important than those already living here and citizens of this country. Until you offer those same jobs to American  homeless soldiers and American homeless women I will not be buying Starbucks.
1/30/2017 12:37,"Hiring 10,000 ILLEGAL refugees? BYE BYE Starbucks...Dunkin Donuts here I come!"

I am sick of Hollywood and the far left  preaching to me all day long!!"
1/30/2017 11:41,"Boycott Starbucks for their latest slander position against it's fellow Americans. Keeping us jobless over illegal immigrants,  shame on you Starbucks!"
1/30/2017 11:40,"Math and reading comprehension is important.  

Starbucks says it wants to hire 10,000 refugees in 5 years in 75 countries.  That is only 26 refugees per country per year.  Another way to look at it is, there are 25,000+ stores, so that's one refugee to every 2.5 stores. With 300,000+ employees, refugees will account for 3% over the course of 5 YEARS.

Starbucks made this same commitment 4 years ago with military veterans and spouses.  5 years 10,000 individuals.  But this is exclusive to the USA.  They have this commitment to this goal till at least the end of 2018.  5,500 individuals already hired and I'm sure they will meet this US goal.  

Within the US, refugees that are hired are ones that the US has employed already as interpreters.  These are individuals that put their life on the line for our military people.  Think they can serve a coffee.

People need to realize that this most companies goal to be highly diverse.  But an application still needs to be filled out, there still needs to be an interview, there still are terms and conditions to the job.  Starbucks/Schultz is not knocking on doors with a hiring letter.  They are not hanging jobs out.

If a homeless person, disabled vet, college student, high school student, unemployed adult, ECT... Wants a job, they are still capable of getting it.  They need to apply.  

Starbucks is only focusing their recruitment to agencies that help the refugees.  Just like they have for the past 4 years focused their efforts in veteran agencies to get veterans jobs.  

If everyone so worried about unemployment in this country.. maybe they should hire an unemployed person or homeless person to do some work for them!"
1/30/2017 11:40,No more coffee at starbucks for us ...
1/30/2017 11:27,"A great big THANK YOU! Howard Shultz for your support of immigrants and for standing up for human decency in the face of the Trump administration. You give all of us strength to make our own stand, wherever we are, in our own way. Pour me another cup of that great coffee! <3"

Soon you¬¥ll be hearing the phrase: You want fries with your coffee"" more often. The problem with the people is, that they never had a politician before, that complies what he promised."

1/30/2017 9:44,"It is incorrect to give preference on job applications.  Business wise and morally defeating equality in itself.  Not only on the job application but also in the work environment. The very thing we freed ourselves for....Equality. (Please Share for complete equality) Our forefathers wrote documents that still mean something to a few of us.
Never is the time to use race, religion, creed, circumstance or geography to publicly give benefits before work.  All Americans who have traveled and now live here have had the same advantages equally to gain and equally to fail by one's own hand... which, in turn creates full self worth Americans working from the dirt.  Americans have attained their lives by their own free and equal hands.  We sailed, got lost and were found upon the shores of freedom.  We fought and won as equal people.  We worked the soil as equal people.  No Kings, No written advantages."

Don't worry about all these negative so called ""customers"" these are the types that aren't ever satisfied and give your worker's hell every day all across the country. Keep moving forward with this amazing plan to help others in crisis. :)"
1/30/2017 6:09,Want to hire ILLEGALS and take OUR US jobs!!! Bye! Have no use for you anymore!!!
1/30/2017 6:02,You lost my business.
1/30/2017 6:01,How arrogant and anti American to establish a program to discriminate against American Citizens in favor of refugees. I'm sure you won't miss my monthly contribution to your bottom line -- so see ya.
1/30/2017 5:57,Thank you STARBUCKS for standing for Equality for all+++  Will continue to purchase from a Business that welcomes EVERYONE!!!
1/30/2017 5:53,THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP FOR MUSLIM AMERICANS AND REFUGEES AT THIS TIME!!!
1/30/2017 5:43,Thank you for supporting the great infrastructure of immigration in America!  It means the world to us all that our businesses are in step with our values.  Can we also see Starbucks taking on the problem of underpaid prison labor?  It is my understanding that your company makes use of it.
1/30/2017 5:43,I am impressed with your CEO 
1/30/2017 5:41,Peace out Starbucks.  Never been a huge fan of the company before and will never be a fan now.
1/30/2017 5:41,"Hey starbucks, when are you going to hire the thousands upon thousands of homeless Americans instead of the refugees? When are you going to look past your selfish choices by supporting others more than your own? Why do you turn away the people with little to no experience yet will hire the ones without? Why do you discriminate against your own country? You say people whom don't have an address or a phone number are unreliable yet will hire the people who will simply choose to leave when they deem fit. Our people as American deserve the job more than the people who were brought here and have caused so much havoc. You have clearly chose to hire as you please. You chose not to help the American that need the help. A job is a job, many people (americans) will be happy to have them part time jobs just to feed themselves. This is a disgrace what you are chosing to do as a company. Why, because they will take the lower wages so you can make more profit? Your coffee isn't all that great and it's over expensive. If you want more profit, then lower your prices. hireamericans Starbucks"

1/30/2017 5:38,"Thank you, Starbucks, for your pledge to hire 10,000 refugees.  I am a very loyal customer (I go nowhere without my gold card; I am a work-at-home parent of two young children), and I am also a proud volunteer with a nonprofit organization based in San Diego called Heart4Refugees, which seeks to provide financial and social support for refugee families who have been resettled here.  Specifically, I participate in their ""Adopt-a-Family"" program, and have had the great good luck and sincere pleasure to meet a wonderful family that fled Aleppo for the sake of their two children and are trying to start their new, American lives.  I am so grateful for everyone who recognizes the essential contributions immigrants make to our country, and who lives up to the moral imperative of being an exceptional nation."

Multiply that by millions around the country next time YOU and your board members decide and post like this! Hiring illegals over tax paying Americans, you just showed us your true colors and they are not RED, WHITE and BLUE! Who's with me? There are plenty of other coffee places out there and many are local people who desire and love this country more.
Take a look at Target stores, they stuck with Obama on letting Men into a woman's bathroom and in December after all their high end and tons of national TV ads, their stock dropped over 13% thats almost a Billion Dollars in sales! WE THE PEOPLE are sick of this kind of one way thinking from corporations and we are doing something about it, that's not doing business with you any longer!"

1/30/2017 3:11,Thanks for taking care of refugees. I will start drinking coffee in your honor.
1/30/2017 3:09,Goodbye Starbucks!   I myself drank your frapachinos because they are delicious.  I don't particularly care to hear your liberal political beliefs!  I will encourage all Americans that share my beliefs to join in.  Make America Great again!

1/30/2017 3:07,"So you are going to hire 10,000 refugees.  Why not hire 10,000 homeless veterans.  Americans first, please."
1/30/2017 3:06,"I am very disappointed to learn that the president and CEO of Starbucks is supporting illegal immigration in the country that I was born and raised in. What's most sad about this to me is that I spend on an average of $100 to $150 a month purchasing from your company as do my family and friends. As many have similar views as myself, those that are termed as the silent majority in this country, I will no longer be purchasing Starbucks. I used to purchase a Starbucks on my way to work everyday. I will be certain to spread the word on social media about your decision to take this stance. It is sad and unfortunate that you did not take the time to read the full decree to its extent; nowhere in the decree is there a statement against immigrants, the issue is concerning illegal immigrants and persons entering our country that havn't been properly vetted. Am I to assume by your statement that you support this type of immigration? If so perhaps you should consider living in a country with open borders as it seems to me that's what your preference is. I believe this to be a statement that was not well thought through or based in fact or reality but simply your narrative of a situation rather than taking the facts as they are and looking at something from a different perspective you have chosen to take a political stand in an arena that was not meant for you. I predict that Starbucks  stocks will decline because those that feel the way I do will stand up for what we believe in and if that means not purchasing from you moving forward then that is what we do, similar to the decline in ticket sales for the Super Bowl following there decision to allow Lady Gaga to perform.  Additionally, I find it interesting that this is the same identical order that Obama gave in 2011 and when I look back and your previous press releases I did not see anything from your company stating your stance on immigration when he issued that decree. How unjust and unfair and un-American of you. 

Regards, 

A former Starbucks customer"
1/30/2017 3:05,"I'm about to lose my job in a month and will be one of the 7.5 million American citizens that are unemployed currently. Why aren't you bothering to offer us jobs?

And let me be clear here - I'm not against the idea of employing refugees or immigrants or foreign workers. What I'm against is the wholesale PANDERING for publicity. Where were these 10,000 jobs 24 hours ago? And this also goes for all the CEOs who met with Trump after his election win - where were those jobs during the 8 years of Obama? It's insincerity masquerading as doing public good.

And, newsflash for Howard Schultz - you aren't helping this situation. Because unskilled and low-skilled American workers are sick and tired of being jobless, while (real or imagined) foreign workers are given a leg up over them and will continue to support protectionist economic policies because they are only seeing the negative effects of open job markets. Mr. Schultz, you are giving Trump and his supporters all the ammo they need.

Have you ever tried applying for a retail or service job lately? Try going in or calling and asking to speak with someone to express your interest. You will (at best) be politely refused and referred to their online job site or (at worst) treated like an idiot and a bother for even daring to ask such a question. You can't even get the OPPORTUNITY to speak with someone but suddenly these companies have OPEN POSITIONS to freely hand out? Something stinks."
1/30/2017 3:04,I will no longer be patronizing Starbucks. Thanks for undermining the safety of all American citizens.
1/30/2017 3:03,"Why don't you start with 10,000 Americans first."

1/30/2017 2:56,"You guys should hire a better social media manager to better serve and engage your customers. Your posts are old, and not interesting much"
1/30/2017 2:49,Time to boycott Starbucks! Put Americans first. How about that? Mcdonald's coffee is better and cheaper anyway. They will always make it fresh for you unlike Starbucks.
1/30/2017 2:46,"I hope the media has it wrong!  Why would you plan to hire 10,000 refugees??  Why don't you hire American citizens who are looking, hoping for employment??   I just don't get your motivation. Hope your CEO realizes Americans employed moves our economy forward."
1/30/2017 2:44,I will not purchase another item from Starbucks ever. Your policies are insane.
1/30/2017 2:42,"So the leftist progressives who are all inclusive and claim that everyone but them are racist, is going to be racist by hireing only illegal refugees and deny Americans the right to work at his coffee shops........hmmmmmm"
1/30/2017 2:36,I am going to get a cup of coffee from one of your stores.  I support Starbucks.
1/30/2017 2:36,If you hire all the refugees then where will the people who majored in gender studies and art history work?
1/30/2017 2:36,Thank you Starbucks for your commitment to justice by hiring refugees fleeing war torn countries.  I very much appreciate your stance and efforts.
1/30/2017 2:36,"Hey, Starbucks!  If you are going to hire 10,000 refugees, have them start cleaning your locations' windows.  They are disgusting.  If you do not understand, please let me know."
1/30/2017 2:34,Keep your $7.00 coffee and gift cards if illegal refugees are more important than legal Americans!!!
1/30/2017 2:33,Thank you for standing up for American values in theses very troubling times. I support you!
1/30/2017 2:30,Why dont you hire some homeless vets or homeless people that could use a job? America FIRST! Dont forget who supports you.
1/30/2017 2:30,", I'm very disappointed in your company, you have a right to hire the best person for your job, but you publicly announced that you are taking jobs away from potential awesome employers specifically given them to a People based on where they came from and not their abilities very disappointing I I shall take my business elsewhere, as will my fellow employers and family members, Boycottstarbucks"
1/30/2017 2:30,Starbucks will hire 10000 refugees.  I'm guessing  with the livable wages they are unwilling to pay American workers.
1/30/2017 2:27,"Sure hope your news that the CEO is more concerned about hiring refugees BEFORE US citizens is fake news, until I hear different I will not , nor will anyone I know buy anything from Starbucks . You don't support the USA , we don't support you.Ì†ΩÌ∏°"
1/30/2017 2:27,"I always go to the source to ask before I judge it's been said your CEO plans on hiring 10,000 refugees? I have no problem hiring the best person but to say it the way it was posted looked like hiring Imigrants over everyone else EXPLAIN PLEASE"
1/30/2017 2:26,"Why is your company hiring refugees, when there are plenty of Americans that need jobs!"
1/30/2017 2:26,"It's all about money and marketing with this company, huh? What happened to that ""2nd home""? What happened to great coffee, a safe feeling, and comfort? I get when a CEO of a company pushes his values and beliefs upon his company, but I really miss when Starbucks was about supporting local communities and helping our troops. This company- their brand, morals, and coffee- is just a joke."
1/30/2017 2:25,Americans over refugees.  NotMyStabucksAnymore
1/30/2017 2:24,"Taking my inspiration from the executive managers of Starbucks, I will show my opinion in protest. Because Starbucks doesn't care about the safety and well being of our country and sides with the people from terrorist countries, wanting to allow them into the United States without strong vetting of who they are which leaves us vulnerable to the entry of terrorists, I will no longer support Starbucks by buying their products. 

I will use what credit is on my account and my rewards, once that is gone I will erase my app and discontinue my support of this corporation. I urge others who believe in protecting our country from terrorism to do the same. 

Starbucks is no longer a coffee company, they are a political machine promoting dangerous policy that could lead to the death of hundreds if not thousands of Americans. 

To search for 10,000 refugees to hire will mean 10,000 American citizens will be overlooked for jobs just to push a political stance. This is irresponsible and discriminating. I hope to see the justice department looking into Starbucks hiring practices as their policies are implemented."
1/30/2017 2:19,I was participating in the Mocha challenge and made my last purchase today but have not received credit. I'm disappointed and would appreciate some help Ì†ΩÌ∏ï

1/30/2017 2:05,"Thank you Starbucks for hiring both veterans, regular Americans and refugees/immigrants. Inclusive work places are the best places."
1/30/2017 2:03,"I'll just get my coffee from a place that is safe, loyal, and patriotic. In case it isn't clear, YOU are not that place. Let us know when you come to your senses, and start putting America first. In America, hire Americans."
1/30/2017 2:01,"THANK YOU, for being a good company and good people!"
1/30/2017 2:00,"Why would you hire refugees rather than Americans who are looking for jobs?

 Time for a boycott."
1/30/2017 1:55,"As a veteran with an application currently in your system, thank you for your stand in committing to hire refugees. I fought to defend this country that welcomed my family so many generations ago as immigrants. I fought to defend my country that offers safe harbor for the down trodden.  I appreciate your devotion for the same."
1/30/2017 1:55,"You should be ashamed of yourselves, so many Americans are looking for, and willing to work, even for minimum wage and you are going to give these jobs to refugees? I personally will never buy anything from your company again and will make sure I post this and repost to reach as many Americans as possible.  What a disgrace you are to America Ì†ΩÌ∏£"
1/30/2017 1:45,Just a note we are tossing our Starbucks cards. Putting dreamers and refugees above American citizens who disparately need work is something I will not contribute to. And please do not tell me they are not replacing American workers.

1/30/2017 1:32,"When I see the message ""Starbucks to hire 10,000 refugees"" I wonder why not hire the people already in this country.  Are we not good enough to work for you - you just want us to buy your products."

1/31/2017 23:56,Heard Starbucks is planning to hire immigrants in opposition to Trump's plans.  Is this true?
1/31/2017 23:56,"Starbucks, and all companies as whole, should keep quiet on political comments. You run the risk of offending your customers and your employees who may very well disagree with your comments, no matter what they are. I've read that the CEO of Starbucks supported Hillary C. As far as I'm concerned, that's a double negative against you, for a myriad of reasons, not the least of which is Benghazi. Get over it. She lost."

1/31/2017 23:47,Thanks for speaking up & acting. I treated myself to a coffee and breakfast today because you did.

1/31/2017 23:34,"Usually I view buying coffee drinks as a waste of money, albeit a delicious one, but since hearing about your commitment to provide 10,000 jobs to refugees (as well as veterans, which I hadn't heard before), I'll have to start grabbing one every now and then to help you support all those workers!"
1/31/2017 23:29,Thank you for hiring Veterans and immigrants.
1/31/2017 23:26,How about you hire veterans
1/31/2017 23:25,"I'm not paying for your CEO's political yearnings. I've been a loyal Starbucks customer for years. Your anti-American ravings make me sick. You're going to hire refugees instead of Americans  - including Veterans - who need a job, potentially putting your customers in danger at the same time. How arrogant of you to assume the people who made you rich share your personal choices. I am someone who voted Trump IN, and I'm voting Starbucks OUT!"
1/31/2017 23:20,I've never liked your coffee.  Thanks for making sure I never try it again.  You are as Un American as it gets.
1/31/2017 23:20,"Starbucks, consider hiring any legal citizen and do not discriminate - keep it business!  If not, you will lose my business.  Have you not read?  The country is looking for safety and did you not notice that past Presidents, Obama (year 2011) and Bush, for example, also put bans on refugees from other countries, such as Iran.....did you protest Obama in 2011,or did you forget?"
1/31/2017 23:20,I am very proud of Starbucks for taking a stand for Human rights. Thank you!
1/31/2017 23:18,Although we love your products and stores (we go almost every day) we will no longer be frequenting your establishments. It is just that I can not stand businesses furthering their personal ideals from their companies influential position. Do you not realise how you have just alienated at least half of your customers by your overt political actions.
1/31/2017 23:15,"I hear Starbucks has been getting some hate calls due to their pro-immigrant stance. I just want to weigh in and say how proud I am for your decision. You did the right thing and I'm sorry you have to get grief for it, but don't let it get you down. I and many others will make a point of buying your coffee. No hardship--it's good!"
1/31/2017 23:14,Thank you for standing up for refugees! I'm proud to be a customer and gold card member.
1/31/2017 23:10,I'm not buying your coffee anymore.
1/31/2017 23:09,"Thank you for your bravery, leadership and steadfastness in standing up to a strongman bully whose desire is to tear this country apart. I'll make sure to stop by and get something good after work tonight. Cheers!"
1/31/2017 23:08,Thank you for your principled stance on Trump's recent executive order!
1/31/2017 23:07,I'm not  your coffee anymore .
1/31/2017 23:05,"Starbucks, I basically swore off coffee but today I bought a big fat trenti coldbrew no sweetener w/ a splash of heavy cream just because you're supporting REAL American values: equality and justice for all, all men being equal! THANK YOU!"
1/31/2017 23:04,Dear Starbucks ..... last I knew corporations don't vote....people vote...... you truly must have that much money to be that stupid..... I guess you don't need my money!
1/31/2017 23:04,Thank you Starbucks for standin
1/31/2017 23:02,Time to Boycott Starbucks- how about hiring the homeless in this Country and giving them a chance? Boycott
1/31/2017 23:00,"Dear Starbucks,
I'm writing you to thank you for facilitating fair trade coffee growing and helping farmers use sustainable techniques.  I'm thankful that you pay for four year college degrees and health care for US employees.  I'm thankful that you have hiring programs for US vets, minorities, and people who live in disadvantaged areas.  Thanks for recently taking the awesome step of committing to providing employment for refugees in your stores around the world.  Without employment, how could there ever be integration into their new societies? You don't have to be an awesome corporate citizen, but you consistently are.  Oh, thanks for the green tea lattes.
Love,
Robert"
1/31/2017 22:58,"Is it true you are going to hire 10,000 Muslims? I love Starbucks, but if this is correct, my drink of choice will change to Tim Hortons. I almost bought some Starbucks stock, thank goodness I changed my mind."
1/31/2017 22:57,Thank you Starbucks for continuing what really makes America great - welcoming refugees & giving them a chance at the American Dream!
1/31/2017 22:57,"You want to help a so-called refugee, open a starbucks in Syria!"
1/31/2017 22:55,After reading of your new hiring decision I will no longer visit any Starbucks.
1/31/2017 22:54,GO SB for fighting against oppression - fighting against an Immigration edict and understanding we inhabit a world not just a xenophobic nation.  Distributed wealth ultimately enriches us all.  THANK YOU!!!!
1/31/2017 22:49,"Thank you. BIG coffee drinker, never go to Starbucks but now will BUY your coffee (at twice the price I pay for the generic brand) because of your stand against the ban."
1/31/2017 22:49,Love you guys !!!! for sticking by the refugees. I don't care what those idiot scurvy mouthed Drumpf supporters think.
1/31/2017 22:45,"Refugees, really! Keep it up you lose my business"
1/31/2017 22:44,Thank you Starbucks for supporting refugees in our country.
1/31/2017 22:44,I'm no longer using your product
1/31/2017 22:43,I love Starbucks!! Thank You!
1/31/2017 22:43,"So you will hire 10,000 refugees ignoring Americans especially Veterans? Cancelling my SB account and only buying from Dunking Donuts."
1/31/2017 22:38,"Hey Starbucks, will you promise to hire 10,000 refugees from the inner cities of America where folks have little to no hope?"
1/31/2017 22:38,"You get what you paid for Chuckie....

"
1/31/2017 22:34,"Did Starbucks offer to hire 10,000 Veterans before or after Obama offered a tax credit for hiring Veterans?? Oh wait... It was right after!!
starbucks"
1/31/2017 22:33,Thank you Starbucks for hiring 10k refugees WORLDWIDE.  I'm sorry so many people don't understand that fact and are complaining about hiring US citizens. Those of us with reading comprehension stand behind you.
1/31/2017 22:33,Thank you Starbucks for supporting American values
1/31/2017 22:30,Heard some people will be boycotting Starbucks so I'll be doubling my visits.
1/31/2017 22:30,"I totally disagree with your statement of hiring 10,000 refugees when we have so many Veterans and other Americans who need a job.  If you have 10,000 openings, why aren't you filling them with citizens?"
1/31/2017 22:30,"Hey, Howard. I love your coffee but keep your politics to yourself."
1/31/2017 22:28,THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING OUR REFUGEE POPULATION.
1/31/2017 22:26,Dunkin' Donuts coffee is cheaper and taste a lot better.
1/31/2017 22:24,Thank you Starbucks for offering them jobs!
1/31/2017 22:23,"Hiring immigrant refugees from foreign countries over American Veterans out of work, or, any American willing to work there and capable of working there, is a blatant slap in the face...no....spitting in the face of the Americans who have patronized Starbucks for decades, allowing it the phenomenal growth it has had. The true colors of the CEO have been shown and they are anything but Red White & Blue. Disgusted. Have No respect for this man."
1/31/2017 22:23,"I think you should hire more Americans,and stop being so critical of President Trump"
1/31/2017 22:19,Really your choice is going to cost you big...
1/31/2017 22:18,"Mr. Shultz,
Good for you on taking a stand for immigrants that is positive.  You may lose a few Trum ""pets"" but you will be held in high regard by millions.  Stay the course!"
1/31/2017 22:17,Hire American!!! I'm boycotting you due to you stating you want to hire illegals. Your product is overpriced anyway.
1/31/2017 22:16,I used to get my morning coffee from Starbucks. I will NEVER go in to one again for any reason!!! You are an anti-American bussiness!! I am digusted!
1/31/2017 22:15,Given your new posture of not hiring American's only non American's...I have 35 dollars left on my card.  I will use it up. Given you charged the firemen in NYC during 9/11 and the country came down down on your company for being unpatriotic...I'm severing my loyalty to this product and company.  It's over for me. You  made your cups smaller and it didn't fool me. You are corporate theives and unAmerican.  Boycott Starbucks!
1/31/2017 22:14,"Taking my business to a local coffee shop. Buy local, avoid Starbucks!!!"
1/31/2017 22:12,Only opening jobs to immigrants is discrimination . I'll be cashing out my Starbucks card and will never set foot in Starbucks again .  You are not American.
1/31/2017 22:10,Your reactionary policies have just cost you a whole family of business. You say don't discriminate but you are doing that very thing by saying that you will hire someone just because they are a refugee - not based on skill or experience.
1/31/2017 22:08,Starbucks howabout instead of hiring 10000 refugees how about hire 10000 UNITED STATES VETERANS that served this country.
1/31/2017 22:03,Thank you Starbucks for supporting refugees.
1/31/2017 22:02,"I only drank Starbucks Coffee, not anymore too liberal for my likings. 10000 refugees, what about our veterans. Dunkin Donuts here I come. I will certainly spread the word"
1/31/2017 22:02,"Boycotts really work, rip Target, Burger King, Disney, Doritos, Ben and Jerry's, and when you guys boycotted Starbucks years ago over the red cup. How I miss you Ben and Jerry's, your ice cream was amazing."
1/31/2017 22:02,"Will never waist time in that store ever again! Many Vets, people needing jobs here hire them you POS."
1/31/2017 21:56,"My family , Starbucks users for several years will stop using you products effective immediately because you operate a business politally. Also I don't like your politics and I hope Starbucks gets what it deserves for taking your silly stand. 
One thing for sure though , you can still enjoy sales in California, New York and Chicago. Need to downsize your ego though:"
1/31/2017 21:53,I will continue to support Starbucks.
1/31/2017 21:51,I'm thrilled to learn of the support to refugees Starbucks!  Starbucks ROCKS!  Will give up my DD's when possible to be supportive.  Proud of these very American actions!!
1/31/2017 21:41,well if trumpers are boycotting them i guess i will have to start buying their stuff
1/31/2017 21:34,I will support Starbucks and other companies doing the right thing.
1/31/2017 21:30,Thank you. I will continue to use my dollars to support companies who stand up for what is right.
1/31/2017 21:26,"I don't do Starbucks often. But after seeing your ad for the tuxedo mocha last week, I decided I just had to have one. I forgot to specify that I wanted a cold one and the barista didn't ask, so I ended up with a hot one. That was my fault. But when I opened it, it looked absolutely nothing like the advertisement. It just looked like a hot mocha with whipped cream on top. No chocolate drizzle or any of the other toppings I saw in the ad. 

I asked the barista if this was indeed a tuxedo mocha. He told me that they didn't have a button for a tuxedo mocha, so they made a chocolate mocha mixed with vanilla.

If you're going to advertise your specialty drinks, could you make sure that your locations are equipped to make them? Or, at the very least, have them tell customers ahead of time that they can't make them? I feel ripped off. Five dollars might not be a lot of money, but it is a lot of money to spend and not get what you ordered."
1/31/2017 21:22,Thank you Starbucks
1/31/2017 21:19,"Is there a problem with your app for iPhone ? I could not open the app at all. And so I deleted it , thinking I would just download it again. Nope! It doesn't want to download! Don't have a problem with any other apps and I have plenty of room. I need this app bc that's where $27 of my Star$ucks are!"
1/31/2017 21:18,Just wanted to affirm your stance on hiring refugees and veterans.
1/31/2017 21:16,"I will not purchase Starbucks ever again. Not because I am a Trump supporter, but because your pledge to hire 10,000 refuges is discrimination to the American tax payer, people that want and desperately need jobs while our taxes go to programs for refugees already.  You Mr. CEO we're promised a job in Mrs Clintons White House and it didn't happen so Americans must pay for your disappointment ? Shame on you! You want to be in politics then run for something instead of pushing your beliefs on us! SHAMEFUL"
1/31/2017 21:15,When is the Retail industry and the Entertainment industry going to learn to stay out of Politics! Yes...YOU HAVE (or HAD) customers and followers from All Walks Of Life and a Wide Spectrum of Beliefs! JUST SOLD ALL MY STARBUCKS STOCK AND DUMPING MY GOKD CARD STATUS!

1/31/2017 21:13,"so you are going to hire 10,000 refugees?  How about hiring all the homeless, poor, down and out?  Build rehabs centers for all the drugs that come in.  Plenty of places right here that you can spend your money on."

I want to know if I can get the 3 beverages I was not able to purchase because of your computer glitch. The expiration date on the carde is 01-31-2017."
1/31/2017 21:13,Immigrants and refugees built this country and will continue to do this. Thanks for standing up for them. The kind of crowd that is screaming boycott right now are the same exact kind of people that pitched a fit and screamed boycott before over your holiday cups.
1/31/2017 21:12,Not interested in your hiring of immigrants. Hire those already in our country. Support USA. Immigrants drain the system!
1/31/2017 21:05,"WOW! HIRE 10,000 ILLEGAL PEOPLE. NOT TO BRIGHT. SAY SO LONG TO MY HARD EARNED $$$$."
1/31/2017 21:04,"No more Starbucks for my family.  All you bleeding hearts suck up that coffee while Americans are going hungry and needing jobs.  That 90 day ban everybody is up in arms about might just keep that terrorist out that plans on blowing up the mall your kids hang out at.  I'm a Vet and a woman and spent a lot of time overseas in many different countries.  Americans are too soft and don't have a clue how ruthless some of these folks can be.  They don't even ask the people coming in if they will even comply to our laws.  ""Are you a terrorist"".....well that just don't cut it.  Some of those countries mutilate women and believe in honor killings.  So if there is a ban to revamp the program, I'm all in.  I can barely pay for my family and now as a retired Vet, I'm having to give up more to pay for all these people that really just want to go home and don't even like our way of life and some would slit your throat as well as look at you.  All it takes it a handful.  Look at 9/11, they waltzed right through the door.  Hollywood and some of these companies like Starbucks are just too soft and I hope your kids don't run into those that just walk on in.  I hope someone in your family doesn't go hungry because a job or welfare was given to a non-American.  I'm sorry, I'm Christian and believe in and HAVE helped, but I have seen 1st hand how those in the countries that are only banned for 90 days live and act.  A little delay in hopes of keeping Americans safe will not bring down the house.   I hope the idiocy that gets people dead doesn't come to your community because it's showing in full force every time I turn on the TV.  I guess I'll go back to black!"
1/31/2017 21:04,"Starbucks has essentially said, F**K YOU to their support of, and belief in, The Constitution of the United States.
As of today, I am ceasing any, and ALL financial support, to Starbucks. 
I will not step inside a retail establishment. 
I will not purchase bulk Starbucks coffee from Sam's Club. 
I am urging Sam's Club to discontinue their sales of Starbucks coffee nationwide. 
They can become a has-been company, for all I'm concerned."
1/31/2017 21:03,I am in full support of Starbucks!!!
1/31/2017 21:01,"Dear Howard Schultz (CEO Starbucks),

Clearly you are an intelligent man, or else, you would not be the CEO of a major company. However, your recent pledge to hire 10,000 refugees over the next 5 years is a dumb one, in my opinion.

Did you know that there were just under 48,000 homeless veterans in the US in 2016? Do you understand that the very freedoms we enjoy as Americans were afforded to us by the sacrifices of the men and women in the military? Do you understand that the very reason people flee to the US are for those freedoms that the military men and women have sacrificed for? Yet you want to offer jobs to people fleeing here, who aren't even citizens, while the very men and women who afforded us those freedoms are living in the streets???

I can't fathom why you would jump on this social media train to defend men and women fleeing here who do not fall under our constitution. As I understand it, the US constitution applies to US citizens. We have US citizens living in the streets. Why are they not important enough to you to offer jobs? Is it because it doesn't fall within your political agenda at the current time? Is it because you won't get funding from certain organizations? Is it because you want to jump right into main stream media to get your name out there?

Here is a thought. Pledge to hire 10,000 or more homeless veterans over the next 10 years. The best reason to do so is because without them, you and I would not have the freedoms that we have today. In addition, veterans making money here are certain to put that money right back into the economy. Furthermore, the US is a patriotic country. You pledge to hire vets, and your business will grow insanely because of that patriotism. 

Instead, you pledge to hire refugees. IF these refugees go through the process of becoming citizens here, that process take years. Until citizenship is acquired, these refugees do not fall under the constitution. Does that mean they aren't people? No, not at all. Does that mean I don't feel for them? No. 

You should set your priorities.  Are refugees in a bad position? Yes. Are our homeless veterans in a bad position? Yes. Our homeless veterans have priority over anyone fleeing to this country. If it weren't for veterans, no one would want to flee here because we would be in the same boat.

You have a chance to contribute in a good, and well needed, way. Choose your priorities wisely.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Smith  - proud US citizen and wife/daughter/cousin/niece/granddaughter/friend of US veterans"
1/31/2017 21:01,"I am so disappointed that Starbucks is discriminating in their hiring practice. Vowing to hire 10000 refugees? So if I need a job I won't get it if there is a refugee next to me also asking for a job? This is straight up discrimination.  Then I see your photos with the rainbow flag... onelove  why can't you all stick to making fabulous coffee and leave opinions and politics alone!!! So, now I have to stop getting my a.m. coffee because your company is being discriminatory. You cannot  expect to remain 1 when you are pissing on so many people's values (with the onelove reference) and hiring refugees to prove a point... you will be loosing lots of customers. I suggest you all stick to coffee and do some damage control. I smell a discrimination lawsuit in the future..."
1/31/2017 20:57,"I hope that Starbucks everywhere... becomes a ""death zone"""
1/31/2017 20:57,"I don't know why Starbucks always needs to get involved. Its everyone thinking they need to prove something. 

Now I can't and won't buy your coffee. Which includes my heavy traffic in store, and large purchases of pods. 

Because my veterans are more important than refugees. 

Yes its sad what has happened to them, but our veterans fought for US. Ì†ºÌ∑∫Ì†ºÌ∑∏"
1/31/2017 20:56,"I will NEVER purchase ANYTHING from Starbucks, nor their brand... again....!!! Hire American!!! Veterans would be the best....!!!"
1/31/2017 20:54,"maybe you should have stay out of politics, you lost my business"
1/31/2017 20:48,Why not hire people with physical disabilities.
1/31/2017 20:47,I applaud you for hiring refugees!
1/31/2017 20:45,Hire American homeless and vets.  boycottstarbucks
1/31/2017 20:42,"This idea of boycotting is so stupid at so many levels.  We should thank Mr. Schultz for hiring refugees, do you people who promote a boycott rather they get on welfare.  He has done the same thing for vetrens in the past.  Think about it by his action there will be many more tax paying people rather than people taking money out of the system.  I can't drink coffee but I'll make sure to buy a cup a day and give it to friend."
1/31/2017 20:41,Thank you for taking a stand.
1/31/2017 20:40,"Good job Starbucks, helping people while also infuriating the alt-tight coffee drinkers. Now I can get my coffee without having to rub elbows with any 'Mercian patriot' mouth breathers, sounds like a win-win!Ì†ΩÌ±ç"
1/31/2017 20:38,No more Starbucks for me.
1/31/2017 20:38,In my opinion as long as we have homeless men women and children scavenging for food in the USA because they are waiting and praying for an opportunity to come there way we should take care of our citizens first. We have little kids who this last christmas wrote letters to SANTA to please not get them anything for christmas. Their mom is really sad because she needs a job she said she would be glad for any job cuz she heard her tell her dad who needs one too. Or my little brother is really hungry you dont have to get me anything but he said he wanted a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I AM sincere we should help all people we can. I am just confused by american citizens going to other countries to adopt kids when we have so many gete looking for a chance at a family ornlooking to hire anyone but an american who needs our help. What is it about many americans who think other people are more deserving than our own who are hurting. In a plane you are told in case of emergency to put the oxygen mask on yourself first so you will be able to take care of you kids. America is in need of an oxygen mask I just hope we can convince others there is NOT ANYTHING WRONG WITH AMERICA TAKING CARE OF AMERICANS BEFORE WE HELP ANYONE ELSE. STARBUCKS AMERICA NEEDS JOBS TO HELP OUR PEOPLE I WILL BE BOYCOTTING YOURS AND ANY BUSINESS WHO PUTS AMERICANS AT THE END OF THE LINE.DO THE MATH EVEN IF JUST 1 MILLION PEOPLE BOYCOTT AND THEY PURCHASED A $3.00 coffee and thats on the low side you lost $3 million not including any additional items theyy purchase with thier coffee.  USA USA USA USA USA
1/31/2017 20:37,Thank you for supporting Immigrants. I went and got breakfast and coffee from you this morning.
1/31/2017 20:37,I plan on purchasing as much Starbucks as my body can handle haha! You guys rock. Thank you for having a conscious and doing the right thing!!!! We need more of this! <3
1/31/2017 20:35,I am going to have all of anyone who will listen to not buy anything from you anymore cause you would rather defend and hire illegals instead of Americans I hope you go out of business for not wanting to hire Americans
1/31/2017 20:35,You Rock Starbucks!!! With all you're doing for our Vets and now helping out refugees.
1/31/2017 20:34,"I think your statement was an atrocity - perhaps if you look at Europe, where I have relatives,and see how the crime has become unconcontrollable or the Middle East, where Christians and Muslims are being killed in honor killings, killed for refusing to convert, where children are raped, it's despicable. I am a refugee, I came from Cuba in 1961 but we assimilated, we embraced this wonderful country. My brother served 4 tours in Vietnam to protect the freedoms that the USA has given us, that allows the lawlessness that is gong on. It is a sad day when a US company turns it back on it's citizens. Oh, and by the way, where was the outrage when Obama did the same thing, where was the outrage when he sent back Cubans to the gulag that is Castro
Castro's Cuba? crickets, I will never, ever spend a dime (laughing) in any of your stores and believe me, there are many more who feel the same. I hope that saner minds will prevail and you will correct this before your company goes down the drain. Rant over"
1/31/2017 20:32,thank you Starbucks for your courageous stand on the immigration and refugee issue. I will be drinking your coffee.
1/31/2017 20:31,"Dear Howard Schultz, I love your coffee and enjoy visiting with friends at your coffeehouses.   I bought stock in Starbucks because of the quality of your coffee and cafes.  I did not buy your stock because of your personal political views.  In fact, your political views and public comments, as CEO of Starbucks, are costing small shareholders a great deal of money.  Although you may be well insulated from drops in the price of your stock, your political views and public positions on social issues are hurting small shareholders.   Do you even think about the impact to your stock price and bottom line (boycotts) when you mix politics and business?  Or don't you care?"
1/31/2017 20:30,"Thanks for hiring veterans, Starbucks. And you give benefits so it's not like a job at Walmart. You are a standup company."
1/31/2017 20:26,Thanks for standing up for refugees!
1/31/2017 20:26,Hi Starbucks! How about instead of hiring 10000 immigrants you hire 10000 veterans??? I bet you wont see this post on your Facebook - I have been a loyal Starbucks customer for many years - just cut up my Starbucks card - you shall see me no more.
1/31/2017 20:26,Won't be going to Starbucks anymore Ì†ΩÌ∏Ç

1/31/2017 20:04,I will no longer be buying coffee and/or any other products from Starbucks...
1/31/2017 20:02,I was dismayed to hear your chief executive say he will employ tens of thousands of refugees. This shows arrogance and contempt for local people and for his own government. These immigrants will be given preference for jobs with your company over local people it seems. No doubt it's cheaper to hire people who are new to a country. These are typical views of a man so privileged that he loses touch with his customers. I'm very tempted to join the calls for a boycott of your company. Very disappointing.
1/31/2017 20:01,"Dear Starbucks:  while I appreciate the concept of helping others, I kindly suggest that before hiring 10,000 non-citizens you hire 10,000 veterans, or 10,000 special needs adults that can function and work, or perhaps 10,000 recently laid-off American workers.  Might be a better choice and help improve your recent image issues.  Just a thought, kindly phrased and submitted."
1/31/2017 20:00,I support your stand on refugees and I am now one of your regular   customers.  I just got my Mocha.
1/31/2017 19:59,"I didn't really care for your coffee before, I will No longer buy it, due to your actions towards our president and country! You liberals keep stirring the pot without putting things into perspective!"
1/31/2017 19:58,I guess I will get my coffee from someone else including the cold coffee from Kroger.
1/31/2017 19:55,It would be great if you would consider putting a digital marquee at entrance if drive through that says what that location is out of. Sucks getting stuck in a 20min drive through only to find out they are out of the beverage you came through.
1/31/2017 19:54,Thank you Starbucks!
1/31/2017 19:53,Why don't you help out our Veterans and hire them instead!
1/31/2017 19:53,"I humbly thank you! I appreciate your courage to step up and do what is right, kind, and just.  The USA is comprised of people from all over the world and their descendants. Thank you again for your stand!! NoBanOnImmigrants"
1/31/2017 19:48,"People don't read.  Starbucks is not hiring 10,000 refugees in the United States."
1/31/2017 19:45,Great job on supporting refugees.   Thank you for doing the right thing.
1/31/2017 19:43,I may disagree with your business practices and products. But you stepped up proving that you do care about the communities and staff your employees reside. To go the distance globally...thank you.
1/31/2017 19:42,"So you've decided to hire 10,000 refugees when we have homeless vets in the streets, vets that don't have jobs, Americans that don't have jobs, but you will hire 10,000 refugees. We are going to ban your company. You should be ashamed of yourself."
1/31/2017 19:42,"absolutely NO reason to hire refugees when so many americans are out of work.  Starting yesterday i will not buy a single starbucks product until you stop the practice.  Will encourage friends not to either.  Hire Americans first, then when everyone is working there will be room for immigrants."
1/31/2017 19:42,Down with starbucks.
1/31/2017 19:41,We're heading to Starbucks today. Heard they're stirring Human Kindness into their goods these days! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚òïÔ∏è
1/31/2017 19:40,Thank you Starbucks and Howard Schultz for your commitment to hire refugees to send a message that hatred and racism have no place in any country.
1/31/2017 19:40,"Thank you for taking a stand against tyranny!!  I rarely go to Starbucks, now...I will be there everyday!!  notmypresident"
1/31/2017 19:38,Thank you for standing on the right side of history in your support of immigrants. Peace.
1/31/2017 19:38,"Thank you for offering to hire 10,000 refugees after Trump's Travel Ban from 7 Muslim Countries."
1/31/2017 19:37,I think its great you want to hire people in need. Start with American citizens in need. Veterans perhaps? Widows of service men and woman? Children who grew up in foster care? People living in shelters? Would love to see that and then I would love to frequent Starbucks.
1/31/2017 19:36,Thanks for standing up for humanity!
1/31/2017 19:36,Hey Starbucks. I know that you have been working with veterens for years. Thank you for all the work you have done with them. And thank you for hiring 10000 refugees. It's good to see a company holding up American values. Even if the media doesn't know what those values are anymore.
1/31/2017 19:36,Done with Starbucks. Never buy your product again. Sell em to a Muslim
1/31/2017 19:34,I was a little surprised when your president (i don't know his name i'll just call him CLEARABLE the CLOWN) to hire immigrants. I hope he can find some to drink your over price garbage you call coffee. i'll  be at DUNCAN DONUTS I believe it's an AMERICAN COMPANY!!!
1/31/2017 19:33,"Way to go on blatantly breaking the law Starbucks. I will never buy your products. I have been a long standing customer. I'm done with you.

"
1/31/2017 19:29,"We don't have a Starbucks in my town, but I do like to stop whenever we are traveling.  I'll make sure to pick up a bag of beans at the grocery store this week too.  Thanks for sticking up for what really makes us great."
1/31/2017 19:29,Thank you for your stance on hiring refugees.
1/31/2017 19:29,"I will continue buying my coffee drinks at Starbucks and I thank them for pledging to hire immigrants. It takes courage to stand up to hate speech, ignorance and fear mongering."
1/31/2017 19:27,"Dear Starbucks, I have enjoyed the wonderful tastes and blends of your coffee for year's and don't mind paying the extra money for it. I've got cups, thermoses, Kcups, etc because you are an American made business.  Apparently you have forgotten that it is the American working class that has made you and your business WHO you are today. If you follow through with hiring illegal refugees thereby REFUSING to hire legal American citizens I can see the hand writing on the wall.  You had to close numerous shops over the years. If you implement your so called ""plan"" you will feel the backlash from it almost immediately.   While I know I am not personally responsible for keeping your business up and running with my purchases, I am one of many that WILL boycott your business effective today. No hard feelings.  Business is business and I will take mine to a company that appreciates that."
1/31/2017 19:27,I will no longer buy ANYTHING from Starbucks.  Good luck making money from all the anti-American groups you so adore.
1/31/2017 19:24,Dunking doughnuts doesn't play politics and they have better coffee!
1/31/2017 19:24,Thank you very much for your stance on hiring veterans and immigrants.  You will be getting more of my business!
1/31/2017 19:15,"Who are the bigots, and hypocrites now?  Trump will not be the one who you should fear.  I'm so sorry that SOROS and the extremely wealthy OWO have blinded you all.  Star Bucks you wont be ripping me off."
1/31/2017 19:14,"I'm going out like I did yesterday and I'm buying veterans, refugees and homeless people coffee. Everyone deserves some tasty coffee"
1/31/2017 19:14,"Boycott this company.  Despicable that they would hire refugees over Americans,"
1/31/2017 19:10,"I hope that while we're waiting for the immigration ban to be lifted, that we get to see some Special Reserve Coffees featured from Somalia or Sudan.   starbucks"
1/31/2017 19:10,I will be boycotting you!
1/31/2017 19:03,"Thank you for standing with the refugees and for your pledge to provide them with jobs. You are on the right side of history, and I commend you for it."
1/31/2017 19:01,I bought a coffee from Starbucks  once...cost me over 6 bucks ..took 1 sip had to throw  it away...it was that bad...hire who U wish..won't  get another red cent out of me
1/31/2017 19:00,"Effective immediately i will no longer be a starbucks customer after the announcement of 10k jobs going to refugees. Way too many veterans and actual citizens who need jobs

I buy 2- iced triple grande nonfat lattes per day, so about $10/day gone.  Poor decision, on my favebook page i see many others making the same decision"
1/31/2017 19:00,"Ahhhh......if only Starbucks would give 10,000 homeless veterans jobs......well, no more Starbucks for me!   A dumb move on the part of management."
1/31/2017 18:59,Love you Starbucks for supporting refugees.  We will support you more than ever because of this!!
1/31/2017 18:58,<3 Thanks for your pledge to hire refugees. Thanks for helping with job creation. Thanks for always going high when they go low.
1/31/2017 18:55,I will TRIPLE my Starbucks purchases after the wonderful announcement of Howard Schultz regarding employing refugees. Thank you-Thank you HS and Starbucks!
1/31/2017 18:55,"Thanks, Starbucks, for your commitment to hiring veterans and their spouses in the U.S. and refugees world-wide!  A real stand-up, patriotic company!"
1/31/2017 18:55,Thanks so much for supporting refugees!!
1/31/2017 18:54,"Well, I, for one, agree with what the CEO said and his actions. Bravo.

It's a very brave and admirable thing to be one of the lone voices who stand up for what they believe in, even in a sea of discontent..

...or just plain racist dumbassery.

Thank you, Starbucks...and Howard Schultz."
1/31/2017 18:54,"Thank you for being a local presence in a global community. I appreciate your commitment to helping those who have challenges to employment succeed, including our youth, immigrants and vets. Thanks!"
1/31/2017 18:52,"I didn't ask them to, but the Starbucks in Ripon, CA just replaced my sister's latte I accidentally dropped, at no charge. Great customer service!"
1/31/2017 18:51,I am a retired policeman from Michigan. I stop at a Starbucks perhaps three times per week. It is your choice to make a political statement regarding refugees and the number you may hire. It is my choice not to patronize your businesses. I will no longer purchase Starbucks products including coffee and K-cups.
1/31/2017 18:51,I'm betting these 10000 refugees won't get jobs without an interview to verify qualifications?  WHY SHOULD PEOPLE ENTERING THIS COUNTRY BE ANY DIFFERENT?
1/31/2017 18:51,My daughter and I just want to say how much we admire your company for their hiring of veterans. <3
1/31/2017 18:48,"I'm not supporting your decision to hire 10,000 refugees while you rebel against President Trump's Executive Decision.

Do you know that out of 300,000 people, only 129 were detained for approx. 24's??

 What's your problem? He's just doing what he said; America FIRST not LAST.. And it's Temporary!! 

 Why not hire Vets & homeless??? 

I love Starbucks but not any more..."
1/31/2017 18:45,So disappointed this morning I always order the vanilla chi tea latte and this morning I received hot milk I think monroe Starbucks needs more training. Ì†ΩÌ∏¢
1/31/2017 18:44,No more Starbucks for this kid.

1/31/2017 18:40,Keep up the good work !
1/31/2017 18:37,"I applaud you offering not only to hire refugees but continuing to support our Vets, I usually go to Dunkin but will start going to you all now, it will be more money but I admire your stance in the wake of the unlawful act by our shameful idiot in chief"
1/31/2017 18:37,Thank you for showing the rest of the world that we are not all the same as DT and his cronies. Your decision is brave and patriotic and just!
1/31/2017 18:35,"LOVE and HUGS! Thank you for standing up and doing the right thing with your international business. Hiring veterans, helping students, and now refugees. I wish more businesses were like you! What a positive impact you are creating in the world. I will continue to support you!"
1/31/2017 18:33,Supporting Starbucks. !
1/31/2017 18:32,"Bravo to Starbucks for having the courage to go on record saying they would hire refugees.  We are living in very xenophobic times, which doesn't say much for our citizens.  These refugees are escaping terroristic governments and deserve our compassion and our assistance.  They are not coming here to harm us but to escape from untold horror in their home countries."
1/31/2017 18:31,"According to the EEOC: ‚ÄúUnder the laws enforced by EEOC, it is illegal to discriminate against someone (applicant or employee) because of that person‚Äôs race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information. It is also illegal to retaliate against a person because he or she complained about discrimination, filed a charge of discrimination, or participated in an employment discrimination investigation or lawsuit"
1/31/2017 18:28,"Just read the article on you hiring 10,000 refugees...I'm a poor hispanic american male and always thought that you were a bit overpriced for my budget but if you stick with this plan I pledge to stop at a Starbucks at least once a week to buy my coffee.  Thank you Starbucks for promoting the american dream."
1/31/2017 18:27,"For the last six to eight years I've been using Starbucks beans or pre-ground coffee, pretty much exclusively.  With your most recent announcement regarding hiring refugees I will refuse to buy your coffee anymore. I knew that you were a liberal company, no biggie, i can overlook that. But once you decided to put refugees futures over that of Americans I lost all respect for you as a company and will no longer drink, purchase or frequent your company. I'd rather drink mud.  I know that I am only one person, but certainly not the only one who feels this way. You have made a huge mistake and i believe your company will suffer because if it."
1/31/2017 18:27,I love starbucks
1/31/2017 18:26,Thank you for your support of refugees. Thank you for being on the right side of history.
1/31/2017 18:26,"I plan to buy more coffee from Starbucks--one for me and one for a police officer. 

Thanks for hiring immigrants. They come here from dire conditions"
1/31/2017 18:26,Thank you Starbucks for helping people in need! I will make an effort to patronize your shops.
1/31/2017 18:25,Thank you for what you are doing for immigrants and what you continue to do for veterans!! <3
1/31/2017 18:24,How about hiring returning vets with no job instead of refugees. My friends and I are all boycotting your establishment.
1/31/2017 18:19,Won't ever purchase Coffee from this company which doesn't care about real Americans.
1/31/2017 18:19,"Hey Starbucks: how about hiring 10,000 veterans?"
1/31/2017 18:17,We stand with you and are very proud of your decision!!  waytogoStarbucks

1/31/2017 18:14,Thank you Starbucks for choosing compassion and humanity over fear and hate ! That's responsible corporate citizenship. I will be enjoying my Starbucks coffee even more now !!
1/31/2017 18:11,"Instead of hiring 10,000 from other country's how about putting 10,000 Americans or veterans to work."
1/31/2017 18:08,Thank you for your compassion and decency!
1/31/2017 18:06,why didn't you complain when Obama did the same thing ????
1/31/2017 18:05,"Shame on you, discrimating against Americans just because they are not refugees. Discriminating based on nationality is wrong and shameful. Starbucks just lowered themselves to Trumps level. Discrimination is wrong for any reason."
1/31/2017 18:04,"Instead of hiring 10,000 refugees why not hire all the 16 year olds that have applied for a job at your establishiment and have gotten zero reponse, one being my daughter.  It's a shame that you will hire a refugee before an American citizen who wants to work.

You put on yours first, then help the guy next to you because if your unconscious you cant help anyone.  The same goes for America.  And thats the attitude you need to have these days.  Nothing wrong with helping others, but help Americans first!  Until you learn to do that, you wont be seeing my face in your stores anymore."
1/31/2017 17:40,"I was just wondering why Starbucks doesn't hire Veterans vs refugee's ? If it weren't for our Vet's, you wouldn't be... A little food for thought."

Where's your 10,000 jobs for unemployed Americans?
I'll be supporting my locally owned coffee houses going forward. 
By the way, you recently announced you did not want customers who believe in traditional marriage and that's fine. But it leaves you with a customer base comprised of gays, lesbians and their supporters. Also fine. But then you want to hire 10,000 Muslims to serve customers that Muslims believe should be beheaded. Makes perfect business sense to me. Good luck with that."
1/31/2017 17:22,Hooray Starbucks for being so amazing. Thank you for your statement to hire immigrants. We need you in more ways than you know.  THANK YOU!!!!
1/31/2017 17:20,Thank you! You have a new customer here.

1/31/2017 17:11,I am a conservative with a liberal us citizen son who was hired by Starbucks in NYC.  My son depending on the job offer of Starbucks temporarily ceased looking for a position but was never put on the schedule.  After many attempts to find out what was happened he was finally told they had hired to many people and could not use him after all.   So here we are being told you are going to hire a whole bunch of immigrants.  Please am I supposed to believe that you care about anyone?

1/31/2017 16:38,Thank you for your outreach and support for refugees. I will continue to be a proud Starbucks consumer.
1/31/2017 16:37,"If you are actually claiming to be hiring Veterans, how about you come out in the media and prove it??? You are jumping on the band wagon as pro Refugees only! Put up or shut up!
Otherwise I'll do my best to lobby a boycott against you."
1/31/2017 16:34,"Sorry I just stopped patronizing Starbucks over this new release and I encourage everyone to do so.  Dunkin Donuts has great coffee too...

"
1/31/2017 16:33,"So what gives? Are you hiring refugees to go against the President's stance or are you trying to help the interpreters? Are there 10,000 interpreters? Be clear on where you stand with the American People, don't pander. Until I know exactly where you stand, I will be drinking my coffee at home."
1/31/2017 16:32,"Thanks to your CEO for his pledge to hire 10,000 refugees worldwide. I approve of your corporate citizenship wholeheartedly."
1/31/2017 16:31,Starbucks; STILL more popular than Donny Boy will ever be with the American people. :)
1/31/2017 16:30,"Too bad Starbucks can't hire 10,000 veterans."
1/31/2017 16:29,"Thanks for what you're doing!  Always lovely to see corporations acting as good community members and citizens.  And this is 10000 refugees world wide, right?  I'm sure there are many European countries that could really use your help :)"
1/31/2017 16:29,"I support Starbucks and their plan to hire 10,000 refugees!"

1/31/2017 16:20,"Hey, I hear there is a boycott because you committed to hiring refugees.  So . . . I usually make my own, but I'm buying my coffee at Starbucks this morning.  Good work.  And I mean that in every way."

1/31/2017 16:18,Thanks to Starbucks for showing their true colors! Selling all stock never darkening their doors and letting all family and friends do the same! Stock is dropping faster than Miley Cirus's drawers! Hope to see it in the $10 range soon!
1/31/2017 16:17,I just purchased 3 25.00 Starbucks cards for Valentine gifts.  I did this in lieu of other gift cards to support Starbucks taking a stand against the horrible immigration ban.  Thank you Starbucks!
1/31/2017 16:17,And thank you for standing up for our veterans.
1/31/2017 16:16,I love Starbucks!!!

1/31/2017 16:13,Thank you for standing up for American values!
1/31/2017 16:11,I don't normally buy Starbucks but I will be now.
1/31/2017 16:09,"Starbucks, thank you for agreeing to hire refugees after the Muslim ban is lifted. Our families will be sure to do business with you in the future. We stand against those who boycott against you. We have your back."
1/31/2017 16:08,"Thank you for supporting veterans, their families, and helping the refugees.  I am glad you are a corporation with a conscience."
1/31/2017 16:07,"Done with you folks, hello DD!!!"
1/31/2017 16:07,Is Starbucks going to bring back the citrus green tea latte ??
1/31/2017 16:06,"Thank you for supporting all Americans and all prospective Americans. Our country was founded on principles of freedom, happiness, and religious tolerance. I will be buying more coffee and food from Starbucks starting now!"
1/31/2017 16:06,Thank for vowing to hire refugees!
1/31/2017 16:01,"Though I don't purchase Starbucks but this statement about hiring refugees is a blatant slap in the face to our President's recent order on immigration.  
Granted you may not like Donald Trump, you obviously didn't vote for him or don't want anyone to know whether you did or not but the fact still remains that he is our President and you should at least try to respect the office.  
This Executive order is an effort to weed out the undesirables and try to bring some peace of mind to American citizens.  Why supposed intelligent folks fail to comprehend this fact is beyond me.  I think you should back down from this statement.
It is my understanding that you made the same statement regarding our Veterans and for that I commend you but to say you will hire illegals is also a slap in the face to every Veteran in our country.  
I wish folks in your position would think before you make such statements.  Think about the fact that you are putting American citizens out of work in favor of refugees that you have no idea whether they are a danger to our country or not and that is a disgrace to us all."
1/31/2017 16:01,"Hey Starbucks ..Instead of hiring 10.000 refugees .. why not hire 10,000 Americans or 10,000 veterans .."
1/31/2017 16:00,"To whom it may concern....your blatent actions against President Trumps decision to ban immigrants is at the very least unpatriotic but shows even ofre so the mentality of those in executive positions calling the shots.  Promising to hire 10,000 refugees over un employed Americans is just pathetic.  Take Starbucks to the middle east and hire your 10,000 refugees.  Help their economy and help keep people in their home land.  That makes the most sense.  I hope the American people can see just how unpatriotic your company is.  I will make sure my family never buys anything from starbucks ever again."
1/31/2017 15:59,Since I disagree with your hiring priorities - I'm taking my business elsewhere - NO MORE STARBUCKS FOR ME!
1/31/2017 15:59,"I heard you're actively looking to hire refugees who need work. While I don't drink coffee, i will definitely take the extra time and effort to stop by my local Starbucks to buy other beverages and snacks, and listen to the stories of the people who work there. When we get to know each other better, we all win. Thank you Starbucks!!"
1/31/2017 15:57,Amen that you will hire refugees.  You've just earned my loyalty forever.
1/31/2017 15:57,And thank you for egg bites!  Delicious!
1/31/2017 15:56,Thank you for supporting both refugees and veterans!
1/31/2017 15:54,"Love you, Starbucks! Thanks for not being in business for money only, but supporting important issues in our nation and world!"
1/31/2017 15:54,Thank you Starbucks for speaking out in support of refugees and hiring refugees and immigrants!
1/31/2017 15:53,"I went to the Starbucks in Dobbs Ferry, NY this morning to redeem my free coffee for the holiday promotion only to be told that it was expired. The expiration date clearly states that it is valid until 1/31/17 which includes today. I then had to proceed to pay for my coffee out of pocket. I am very hardhearted by this. Anything that can be done to rectify this experience would be appreciated."
1/31/2017 15:53,"To Kevin Johnson & Howard Schultz (CEOs):

Instead of hiring so many refugees in the future, what about hiring homeless and vet usa residents first?"
1/31/2017 15:50,Maybe Starbucks should take care of homeless Americans and vets before they worry about refugees!!
1/31/2017 15:50,You're free to express your political beliefs just as I am free to no longer support your product. Black Rifle Coffee Company is better anyway.
1/31/2017 15:50,Rock on Starbucks!!! Stand for Humanity!!!!! I will increase my purchases in solidarity!
1/31/2017 15:49,"Thank you for supporting refugees. I usually don't visit Starbucks, but I will make it a point to now become a customer as a way of thanking you."
1/31/2017 15:49,Thank you for providing an opportunity for those who need it most. This will strengthen our economy. Your kindness will be rewarded!
1/31/2017 15:49,"While I am not a big coffee drinker anymore, I wanted to voice my APPROVAL of your choice to stand and salute our Yankee Rose rather than giving her the finger as Lord Commander Marmalade has done."
1/31/2017 15:48,"Bravo, Starbucks for standing up for what is right and good - AGAIN! I am certain you we withstand yet another boycott. Didn't they all leave when you supported marriage equality?"
1/31/2017 15:47,"Many thanks for the wonderful stand you're taking on refugees, as well as with our veterans.  I am neither, but I am in awe of people/groups/corporations who have a moral conscience and believe in the dignity and worth of all humanity.  Namaste, ~ Birdi"
1/31/2017 15:45,"I stand with Starbucks!  I love their coffee and support their policy of hiring 10,000 refugees!"
1/31/2017 15:41,"Well, there are plenty of other coffee stands around. You left wing freaks do not need any more of my money."
1/31/2017 15:39,How about hire the unemployed Americans before you give jobs away to refugees?  boycottstarbucks
1/31/2017 15:36,"I applaud and support Starbucks for their stance on hiring refugees! Small actions have large consequences and ripple effects. Despite the hateful and bigoted comments that are coming from fear and uncertainty- it is for leaders in all areas of life, whether it's politics, arts and entertainment, commerce, the medical and technology fields and for everyday, ordinary people to stand up against histrionics and knee-jerk responses and to stand up for what is right.
YEA STARBUCKS!"
1/31/2017 15:36,"I just want to thank Starbucks for taking such a strong public stance in support of dreamers, refugees, and the ACA, and in opposition to a wall with Mexico. I am so glad we hare a vision of the American we all want to live in. Again, my thanks."
1/31/2017 15:35,"Starbucks:  so happy about your stance on hiring refugees!  Love to see business standing up to unconstitutional, un-American insanity.  Thank you"
1/31/2017 15:35,"Hello! I was looking for some help with the app and ordering for in store pickup. My daily drink of choice is an iced flat white. But I am unable to order it and pick it and pick it up because under the flat white there is no option for ""iced."" Any chance of the app adding this option?"
1/31/2017 15:32,"THANK YOU for committing to hiring 10000 refugees!  I love Starbucks for the coffee --- but I will stop by even more (and encourage every person I know who cares about America, humans, and basic moral decency) to redouble our buying from you  YAY STARBUCKS!!!"
1/31/2017 15:28,"Starbucks, I travel all over this country for work stopping into many of your locations. every week I spend a minimum of 10.00 a week there. No more, that's 520.00 minimum out of your corporate registers from just one customer. your views have a price."
1/31/2017 15:28,i boycott Starbucks coffee. Thanks for being a toy in the politics. was the Boston bomber. Would of you hired them ?
1/31/2017 15:22,"You are shi¬£¬£ing on the very country that gave your company the opportunity to be successful. How about you hire 10,000 veterans who fought for your company to have the chance to be successful. I will never frequent your establishment again. neverstarbucks"
1/31/2017 15:19,"Thank You Starbucks, for standing up for Refugees.  You are truly heroes!"
1/31/2017 15:19,"Starbucks Mission has nothing to do with hiring refugees... although yours is not a typical business Mission I think it is a bad move Howard. It was a nice letter and I felt the emotion you conveyed. I live in Budapest and spend a fair amount, here in Starbucks (coffee or 2 every day) and I can assure you there are other coffee choices. I will use those other sources from this point until Starbucks becomes more of a coffee shop and less of a tool for a political agenda. If I applied for a job at Starbucks and refugee got the job over me I think I would consider suing Starbucks for unfair labor practices. Your action has NOT inspired my human spirit. 
Good luck."
1/31/2017 15:17,"Thank you for being a wonderful, inclusive company."
1/31/2017 15:17,Thank you for standing up for refugees.
1/31/2017 15:16,"They are a political statement corporation. As soon as this became evident i sold the stock I owned, irregardless of the nice dividend they paid, politics and business don't mix.  
Be gone Starbucks!"
1/31/2017 15:15,Well done Starbucks. Keep up your hiring practices.
1/31/2017 15:15,"I used to enjoy my Starbucks, but will switch to McDonalds or another brand, as you have made it clear that you think hiring refugees is more important than hiring US veterans."
1/31/2017 15:14,So is Starbucks going to officially declare itself a safe zone or have you all done that already and I missed it?
1/31/2017 15:14,your prices are outrages mc Donalds  is  is much better coffee  get off you high horse   as for hiring refugees  lets talk Americans first let s   put that in the main news and if you want 100s of refugees in the USA let them say at the CEO of starbucks  house
1/31/2017 15:13,"With American workers having a hard time finding work the CEO is giving 10,000 jobs to refugees?

1/31/2017 15:07,"No, really how do I delete my account?"
1/31/2017 15:06,There are many Americans who can use a job before we start hiring refugees. I do hope you reconsider a blanket statement like that.
1/31/2017 15:04,Thank you for offering jobs to refugees and immigrants!  We need more companies to step up!  And we know you are also hiring veterans!

1/31/2017 14:56,It is really frustrating posting on people who think you are hiring refugees over veterans. It's pretty sad how they assume. Glad I looked at your comments in your latest post to see you have been hiring Veterans for years now.
1/31/2017 14:55,"So... you plan to hire 10,000 refugees.... I'm not sure about the legalities of it all, but WHAT IF you have the opportunity to fill those 10,000 positions with American citizens? Are you going to turn them down because the refugee should have the job over an American? Cause I'm pretty sure that would be an illegal form of discrimination. Which is also what you're hooping and hollering about saying Trump is doing. And another thing. These ""men"" that are running away with their tails tucked need to turn around and go back and fight for the country they love so much. These folks don't want to come here. They don't want your job. You support gays. That means these Islamic folks don't like you. You think Christians ""hate the gays"" well them folks over there throw them off buildings and chop their heads off. But sure. Go ahead and support them. That makes a whole awful lot of sense."
1/31/2017 14:55,Although I avoid coffee shops - the odor of burnt coffee just turns my stomach - I may have to start ducking in to Starbucks for pastries.

1/31/2017 14:50,"So many White racist in these post. Btw, boycotting will do nothing."
1/31/2017 14:46,I pretty much only drink Starbucks coffee and have been a regular at my local Starbucks for years. Not anymore. I refuse to spend another penny at any of your stores. Why don't you offer those jobs to people that are struggling to get by in this country? You disgust me.

1/31/2017 14:41,Did the raspberry syrup change recently? For more than 10 years my drink of choice has been a venti rasperry/vanilla latte but recently it tastes different. And the red coloring was either removed or the last few times the barista has not added the rasberry or put something different in its place. If this is the case please bring the original back. Thank you.
1/31/2017 14:41,"Starbucks.....when will you hire 10,000 homeless American veterans?  Perhaps that is when I will consider buying your coffee!"
1/31/2017 14:40,Congratulations on your immigration stance.  I purchased coffee today in direct response to your position.
1/31/2017 14:36,Thank you for the humanity
1/31/2017 14:31,THANK YOU for standing up for refugees. I'm off to order an extra couple of latte's.

How is an American homeless person not a refugee in his or her own country, and, why shouldn't we help our fellow American citizen first before even contemplating or protesting whether or not to allow foreign-born refugees into this country?

Ask yourself this question and feel free to share your answer."
1/31/2017 14:09,Any chance of ever bringing back Almond syrup for lattes?

1/31/2017 13:54,"Concerning President Trumps temporary restriction of immigrants and refugees from a small group of Muslim countries. it appears that Mr Schultz was implying that in restricting such entrance into our country an injustice was being performed.
Did Mr. Schultz make such a public statement when President Obama restricted refugees from Iraq in 2011?
That being said President Trump Has put a temporary hold on persons coming into our country from countries where it is nearly impossible to vette these persons sufficiently. Just like President Obama did in 2011. As a matter of fact the list of which countries to restrict was a list created by the Obama administration. 
As a matter of fact 91% of Muslims are still eligible to immigrate to the U.S. 
It would seem to me that the CEO of Starbucks would be more agreeable with keeping his customers safe.
BTW Migrating to the U,S. is a privilege not a right.

1/31/2017 13:49,"Dear Starbucks,
I would like to request you extend the same offer you made towards refugees and potential illegal residents to our veterans of the military and America‚Äôs homeless population. I do believe they can more than adequately supply the necessary skills to froth a latte.  There is nothing wrong or inhumane about taking care of our homeland first. This is the practice of putting the oxygen mask on first before assisting others. It is unfortunate that you felt the need to cause so much division amongst your customers. You actually pay the price in your bottom line. I will take my stance with my money and will no longer be supplying you with a cent.
Sincerely,
A USA Patriot America first for taking care of Americans first"
1/31/2017 13:48,Thank you for supporting refugees! I will be purchasing more Starbucks to help offset those who are boycotting!

1/31/2017 13:46,"‚Ä™It's interesting, how Starbucks can create ten thousand jobs for refugees, and Airbnb can house them for free; but when it comes to our veterans, and our inner-city trouble youth, and struggling Americans, what do we get? Lectures, by rich celebrities and politicians on how compassionate we should be, while they stay protected by walls and armed men. And they wonder why we have to say Americans first, because we haven't been first, we been treated like noncitizens in our own country. How about having some compassion for us, how about putting us first, for the first time?‚Ä¨"

Until we have a true system of Vetting, Responsibility, Accountability, Commitment and Appreciation from those who cannot even control their own overpopulation and mandate we change to support their needs and religion in our own country, many of us will boycott your stores.  Terrorism is a threat to all nations and until we take a strong stance in protocol and policy then we contribute to the demise of what is left of innocent law abiding global citizens. Effective immediately, our family, our employees and our knowledgeable and proud to be an American Vets will no longer patronize your stores."

1/31/2017 13:27,"Your CEO made it clear just a few years ago about how he felt about Christians and those that had shares in his company. He tramples on biblical principles, funds Hillary Clinton (her list is too long for details) and rises against our President. Your company opposes anyone that holds any biblical standard at all. I URGE CHRISTIANS AND THOSE THAT UNDERSTAND THE BOTTOM LINE OF THE ONLY THING THIS COMPANY REALLY STANDS FOR TO STOP BUYING THEIR PRODUCT. NOT BC OF ONE THING BUT BC OF ALL THINGS THEY FUND. boycottstarbucks"
1/31/2017 13:26,Starbucks in the CEO should be ashamed the fact that they want to put refugees above Americans is a disgrace to this country
1/31/2017 13:23,"Please kindly remind people
You also employ many veterans. 
And if people boycott, they might as well 
NOT call themselves patriotic, as many veterans and their families work here.

Hey peeps....
Boycotting Starbucks is spitting on your own people...
You know .....veterans!

Remember the past...
Some always seem to forget facts.

So stop with the BS.

1/31/2017 13:19,"Starbucks promised to hire thousands of refugees. 

Why not be American and hire thousands of veterans?"
1/31/2017 13:19,"Thank you for pledging your support to refugees!  I will be using the power of my dollar, and purchasing Starbucks much more frequently now.  Thank you for being a stand up company that supports justice for ALL."
1/31/2017 13:19,"The CEO of this company is sending the wrong message.  It is great that we wants to add more jobs, but isn't it against the law to discriminate in the hiring process?  His motives are political and doing no one a service"

1/31/2017 13:15,I support your CEO's statement of support for refugees and DACA!  I am buying Starbucks again - just bought a green tea latte.  But please fix your labor practice of understaffing and not giving enough hours to employees who need them.
1/31/2017 13:14,Just said NO to starbucks...please join me.  New CEO please.  Try hiring Americans or are you going to lay off Americans to hire refugees?  Lots of places will sell me overpriced coffee  and muffins.
1/31/2017 13:14,"Hey Starbucks... Instead of hiring 10,000 Refugees... why don't you hire 10,000 Veterans!!"

 ""And we will start this effort here in the U.S. by making the initial focus of our hiring efforts on those individuals who have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel in the various countries where our military has asked for such support.""

PERSONALLY, I FEEL YOU ARE BATSHIT CRAZY FOR MAKING THIS DECLARATION. FIRST OF ALL, WHY WOULDN'T YOU DECLARE TO HIRE 10,000 VETERANS? PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY FOUGHT FOR THIS COUNTRY AND DEFENDED OUR FREEDOMS SO THAT COMPANIES LIKE YOURS COULD PROSPER. WE HAVE WAY TO MANY HOMELESS VETERANS OUT THERE NOT ABLE TO FIND WORK AND YOU WOULD RATHER HIRE PEOPLE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS FOR OUR COUNTRY? JUST LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN GERMANY WHERE ALL THE REFUGEES ARE STARTING RIOTS AND DESTROYING PROPERTY IN AN OTHERWISE PEACEFUL COUNTRY. I FEEL THAT YOU HAVE A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY AS AN AMERICAN BASED COMPANY TO STAND FOR AMERICA FIRST AND STRIVE TO BRING JOBS TO ALL THE UNEMPLOYED VETERANS AND HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE IN AMERICA. I PERSONALLY WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM YOUR COMPANY UNTIL YOUR STANCE CHANGES IN THIS MATTER. I KNOW THAT I AS ONE PERSON WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE BIG SCHEME OF THINGS BUT I HAVE A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO STATE MY STANCE AND THOUGHTS ON THIS MATTER. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL RECONSIDER YOUR STANCE AND MAKE AN EFFORT TO MAKE AMERICA THE BEST COUNTRY WE ONCE WERE."

Starbucks LOVES Vets and promotes EVERY opportunity to hire them. Even acknowledges their service with special aprons. EVERY American I know, that has good people skills and wants a job at SB HAS been hired. So get your facts straight...go to Starbucks HR and get the numbers and stop making things up!!
That's the biggest problem we have now is people not taking time to get informed and posting silliness. Get INFORMED."

1/31/2017 11:02,Hire veterans not refuges.  Done with you until you do
1/31/2017 10:59,"Bravo Starbucks - thanks for standing up to Trump's tyranny. 
Hiring 10,000 refugees is the pushback you can make and shows that your company can make a stand."
1/31/2017 10:59,"How about hiring veterans and if any jobs are still unfilled, then consider immigrants. Why doesn't anyone think of our veterans? Trust me, what they get after retirement and/or returning from war isn't much. I know, 20-year USMC wife."

The universe of people likely affected by the travel suspension is around 90,000 ‚Äî not 109. The White House should also not use the overall daily number of travelers as a comparison."
1/31/2017 10:05,"Hey, I'm sure this isn't something that will be paid attention to, but I figured I'd at least not give up:

I liked sugar free hazelnut. It's my jam. Why'd you get rid of it? You've taken away one of my only reasons to buy at starbucks. I don't need the sugar crash, and I don't like your other sugar free options.

I'm told it was removed from the menu for ""corporate reasons"", but those aren't being shared to a customer. What gives, guys?"
1/31/2017 10:01,I just wanna say I love Starbucks & love the fact that they take a stand in very controversial issues whether they know their customers or not...I will be there tomorrow getting my cold brew!!!

1/31/2017 9:34,As CEO of a publicly traded  compqny you have an obligation to protect the investment of those shareholders.  Making politically motivated statements using the companies platform is unwise and not in the best interest of those shareholders as you may alienate customers.  Do your political stance on a personal basis not on the companies or shareholders dime.
1/31/2017 9:30,"My letter to Starbucks:

I have been a loyal customer for many years and have encouraged family and friends to make Starbucks a part of their daily coffee needs. Yesterday' Starbucks announced that it would be hiring 10,000 refugees over the next 5 years. Later, I saw a meme on FB that made me think about this. It basically was asking why don't you hire 10000 Vets, I had to take a step back. You see, I am a Veteran too. I served in Iraq three times and Starbucks statement of action caused me to relook at what Starbucks now represents. 

My conclusion? I will no longer be a devout customer or stockholder. Yes- I believed in the company so much I bought stock on the market. However, as of last night I sold all of it. In short, it's been a nice ride but in the end what and who I support must also be in alignment with my beliefs. I'll be donating the remaining funds on my Starbucks Card to a Vet.

1/31/2017 8:38,Not waiting in line for your overpriced coffee anymore when it's funding your misguided politics. I won't be back.
1/31/2017 8:18,Instead of hiring refugees...why dont you hire veterans??? Or help out abused women who are living in shelters!! I will no longer be a starbucks customer!

1/31/2017 8:08,"So I went through the drive thru today and ordered a mocha cappuccino, my fave ! Only to be given a mocha frappucino which I took anyways because I had places to be. I called at some point and explained what happened, the girl was nice and said I can get my actual order tomorrow free BUT my only complaint is when she asked my name which you can see is NOT Elizabeth... She said ""that's fine"". I'm sorry, my name is not Elizabeth and if I wanted to be addressed by that name I'd of changed my name years ago, not a big deal but I'm feeling petty and I found it rude she cut me off when I was spelling my name for her.

Did you know it is a violation of federal law for the CEO of a publicly traded company to act against the best interests of its shareholders?

1/31/2017 7:25,"You can definitely tell who are Trump supporters on here, the ones who don't do research or read anything before they post and boycott things. There's a wonderful thing called the internet. It lets you search things you know nothing about, but allows you to LEARN more about things before you open your mouth and spew out nonsense and hate you're spreading because you can't simply take the time to read that Starbucks DOES HIRE VETERANS!!! They said 10,000 jobs world wide!!!! They are one of the many companies that do hire veterans and have programs specifically for veterans. Thank you Starbucks!!!"
1/31/2017 7:18,Instead of hiring so many refugees who haven't contributed anything to our country.  Why dosent starbucks hire veterans who have protected your ability to operate freely in this country.. there are plenty out there in need of jobs.. these people need help too

1/31/2017 6:31,"It's amazing how people just jump to conclusions about your company and give into blind stupid rage over nothing..... 

Yes they do hire veterans, they are doing this year round and offer great benefits for all their employees. 

All they are doing is opening a door for a group of people who also deserve a chance to make their lives better, just like all of us have that opportunity. Half this county is anti refugee and that is sad. So many forget that a few centuries ago a group of people landed on the eastern shores of this country seeking freedom from persecution and oppression in the same exact way.... on a rickety wooden ship. Americas first refugees who entered here illegally, 

You all including myself may have been born here, but trace back your family history over time and if it doesn't possess anything Native American, your ancestors certainly weren't originally from here either...... immigrants/refugees built this country and they will continue too...."

1/31/2017 6:23,"Hey Starbucks.  Don't worry about this supposed ""boycott"".  They never work.  Especially when they're run by the alternative fact crowd.  These slobbering mental cases couldn't successfully organize different shaped pegs into their corresponding holes, let alone any kind of "" boycott"". A good number of them can't even organize spelling the word ""coffee"". You're doing a good thing, which is what matters.  These pearl-clutching wrinklebeasts will forget all about it in three days anyway, as they always do.  They're not real bright."

1/31/2017 6:12,"Hey Starbucks,

Thank you for being an upstanding company and for setting an example to other companies that doing what is right is always the right choice. A lot of CEO's of companies are too afraid to do good things like supporting refugees, because they don't want to upset customers, lose sales, or make enemies. You guys are showing that some things are more important than that and I couldn't be prouder. Thank you.  ‚ù§ 

I'm going to smile extra big when I get my white chocolate mocha in the morning knowing it's coming from a place that supports something so near and dear to my heart. I hope others follow your example.

The problem is that when your CEO makes his distain public, representing Starbucks, you can expect those who honor and respect the office of the Presidency will respond accordingly. I can live without your overpriced coffee and I certainly will not be buying your gift cards for clients."
1/31/2017 6:06,"I visit Starbucks occasionally but after your pledge to hire refugees AND criticizing our current dictator's policies, I will be visiting more often! GOOD FOR YOU!"
1/31/2017 6:05,"Thanks again, Starbucks, for standing up for what is right!"
1/31/2017 6:02,"Please keep your CEO out of politics, just lost me...didn't hear you vow to hire 10,000 VETERANS, signed, Trump supporter"
1/31/2017 5:58,"It's ok to feel for the refugees, I sure do, but to say you will hire them to spite President Trump when he is trying to keep our country safe , and remember , it's a temporary ban,  there are too many people to feel for here at home but never have you had something to say about any one down and out here at home. When Obama did this same thing did you stand up then? 
One sided hypocritical people!
I don't need your overpriced coffee"
1/31/2017 5:53,"Never again will I ever under any circumstances patronize Starbucks. You are about to be taught a huge lesson.

Trump supporters are a tough crowd and you are now in our crosshairs. It is intuitively obvious that if, through a very strong boycott if we can reduce your gross revenues by say, 25%, we will destroy your bottom line since it is composed of marginal sales after you cover fixed and variable costs. 

This is serious business. Given the fact that many Trump supporters are sophisticated capitalists, we will also profit by selling your stock short."

1/31/2017 5:43,"Here is a question for the anti-Trump refugee issue supporter;

How is an American homeless person not a refugee in his or her own country, and, why shouldn't we help our fellow American citizen first before even contemplating or protesting whether or not to allow foreign-born refugees into this country?

Ask yourself this question and feel free to share your answer."

I've kept my mouth shut about many of your policies because I just would rather keep the peace. However, how about hiring 10,000 veterans? Or Veteran's spouses or children?  If I lived anywhere NEAR a Starbucks, I'd love to work there. 
10000Veterans"
1/31/2017 5:35,"Really starbucks!? Gonna hire 10,000 refugees over the next five yrs!!!??? Is this a true statement or a made up false rumor!!?? If it is a statement from your organazation. Don't you think that's a little obserd! We have many Americans in our country without jobs!!! Why would refugees have more of a chance then the people that live in the community and support buying ur beverages everyday!!!??? The sons and daughters of the adults that support ur corporation!!??? Making this decision, I will stop buying your product!!! And I like it alot!! Support your local branch communities, not other countries! AMERICA IS LOST!!! Ur organazation is not supporting the  American people making this decision!!!"

1/31/2017 5:24,"Wow!!!!! Starbucks would prefer to hire 10,000 refugees than 10,000 veterans.  What a messed up policy from a messed up board of directors."
1/31/2017 5:23,"I'll be visiting only local coffee houses and brewing my own at home from any brand but yours until you fire that idiot CEO of yours. You want to give jobs to illegal immigrants over the unemployed legal citizens of this country, then you won't get another dime of this citizens money. Ì†ΩÌ±ãÌ†ºÌøª bye"

1/31/2017 5:23,Why would any CEO of any company make a statement that will cause the company to lose part of it's customer base? Idiotic.

1/31/2017 5:17,"It is absolutely DISGUSTING that you are offering 10,000 refugees jobs but NOT OUR UNEMPLOYEED VETERANS and other AMERICANS.  I would boycott your stores but you serve the worst hot chocolate I've ever tasted."

1/31/2017 4:31,"Starbucks, I have always liked your products and atmosphere. Your employees have always been very nice and the service quick, and you've always seemed to take care of your own. Then you came out in strong support of the LGBQT movement and I loved you even more. Now you are promising to hire those seeking refuge in our country. I didn't think I could love and respect this company any more than I already did, but this new mission has intensified every feeling I have for you. Thank you for standing up for those who cannot stand up for themselves, as well as all the veterans you have helped over the years (to all the haters out there). Keep up the amazing work!"

1/31/2017 3:44,Starbucks... although I'm very happy you want to help those in need.  Start at home first. Has your company hired any homeless people? Got a place to stay for a month while they get on their feet?  I'm just saying this because so many are quick to express hatred when some people make decisions that you don't agree with. We ALL can fall short of humanity and compassion.

I feel that he is doing everything he should be to secure the people in America from harm. Starbucks has a long history of supporting liberal ideaologies and I've overlooked it for the most part. But honestly, when a company enters the political arena and outspokenly alienates half of their customer base, that's bad business. I'm sure my lack of patronage will be but a minor blip in your radar. As your CEO has stated he doesn't want my money anyway, so, he won't get it. I will also be encouraging everyone I know to discontinue their patronage as well."

1/31/2017 3:09,"Starbucks has said they will hire 10,000 refugees. Why not 10,000 homeless veterans? I'm just curious."
1/31/2017 3:07,"Thank you for your commitment to hire refugees at your stores around the globe. 
I appreciate what you have done for Veterans in the past.  
I love that you can keep your compassion in the business world."
1/31/2017 3:06,I have been a Starbucks drinker for over 20yrs. I am sad to say your values no longer align with mine and I will no longer patronize your establishment. I'm choosing to put my money where it will be invested in things that I believe in that align with my moral values and things that are important to me.
1/31/2017 3:04,"Why some people always try to twist things in a negative way. Starbucks' CEO NEVER said he would not hire Americans or Veterans. He is being inclusive and supportive of all nationalities and races, which is what ALL OF US, AMERICANS should do.
Thank you Starbucks for supporting refugees in their time of need! Not to worry, as you will probably get a new customer for every person who viws to vows to take their coffee addiction elsewhere"
1/31/2017 3:04,Thanks Howard!
1/31/2017 3:03,I will NEVER step foot in your establishment again!!!!  How dare you give jobs to refugees when there are Americans that are here legally that need it. SHAME ON YOU!!!!
1/31/2017 3:01,"StandWithStarbucks Ì†ΩÌ≤ï 

THANK YOU for being human!"
1/31/2017 3:00,"Thank you for standing with refugees, I've always loved your products and now I have more reasons to spend my money with you!"
1/31/2017 2:58,I supporte you 100%
1/31/2017 2:58,I support your pledge to hire refugees. Thank you for having a compassion for all humans regardless of country of origin.
1/31/2017 2:57,Boycott Starbucks due to the anti-American rhetoric of Howard Schulz.
1/31/2017 2:57,Thank you STARBUCKS for standing up to the ban. I support STARBUCKS.
1/31/2017 2:56,"Thank you Starbucks for having a heart big enough to support all humans - veterans, veterans families, refugees & everyone else.  America could use more companies like you that recognize the value of all humans over dollar signs. LoveTrumpsHateAndFear"
1/31/2017 2:56,"STARBUCKS YOU SAY STARBUCKS IS GOING TO HIRE THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES ,WHAT ARE YOU DOING FIRING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING FOR YOU NOW ,AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE MADE YOUR COMPANY AND WE CAN BREAK YOU ,AND THATS WHAT WE ALL ARE GOING TO DO ,YOU PEOPLE ARE AS BLIND AS THE DEMOCRATS ,YOUR FIRED BOYCOTT COMING I CAN PROMISE ,WE THE PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR TRUMP  WILL STOP BUYING ,HOPE YOU TAKE EBT CARDS AND FOOD STAMPS"
1/31/2017 2:54,Hiring refugees over Americans.  Guess I've had my last vanilla bean frap.  Stick to coffee and stay out of forcing your political agenda on others.   Last time I checked America had spoken and elected Trump.
1/31/2017 2:52,"So last week it was...anyone who believes that marriage is only between a man and woman can go elsewhere..this week it's your going to hire 10,000 refugees. You just keep opening your mouths and inserting your foot. I hope your corporation closes and the CEO ends up bankrupt."
1/31/2017 2:52,Thank you for your inclusive and humane hiring policies. You have my business and my admiration.
1/31/2017 2:51,"When an American Company cannot and will not put American safety first, you will no longer receive the business of our family. There are over 2,000 of us. You have been boycotted by ALL of us!"
1/31/2017 2:51,You guys are the best!
1/31/2017 2:50,"Hey Starbucks.  I live in NH. I normally run on Dunkins. No more (nothing to do with DD)! I am now buying all my daily coffee and snacks at my local Starbucks. Thank you for being the kind of company that takes care of all people equally not just those who look like our founding fathers. I'm telling my friends, it's Starbucks from now on. 10000refugees allforoneandoneforall equalityforall muslimsaremyfriends"
1/31/2017 2:48,Thank you Starbucks for having the croissants to stand up for what's right!!! I don't really go to SB often - I will be going more often now!
1/31/2017 2:48,"Thanks for making my decision to switch to Dunkin Donuts a whole easier with your decision to hire 10,000 refugees instead of local workers. For Mr. Schultz to make the statement that the ""American
Dream"" is in jeopardy with the election of President Trump after 10 days in office shows the true political color of your company's 
beliefs.  ""Fake statements"" are no different that ""fake news"" when
the spin is put on designating the countries already on terror lists as a ""ban on Muslims"". Nice try, but you are underestimating the electorate who have already expressed their desires by voting for
someone who is not as politically correct as you would like for us to  be. Nice legacy you are leaving for your successor now that you are stepping down.  I am sure your letter to the world made you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, but that reveals your disconnect with the average American.....the same mistake that Hillary made!"
1/31/2017 2:47,"You are in big trouble Starbucks. You will fall like all the other companies boycotted by the Tea Party and extreme right.
Coke, GE, Johnson and Johnson, Buffalo Wild Wings, Sonic, Target, Walmart, Advance Auto Parts, Home Depot, Oprah, AT$T, Macy's, Pepsi......Wait haven't they boycotted you before? Like three times for not hating gays or something?"
1/31/2017 2:46,"Enough is enough.  Since you have decided to promote illegal immigration by hiring 10,000 of them I have decided to it is in my best interest to start getting my morning coffee somewhere else.  Starting tomorrow I will be going across the street from your store to Lasater's to get my coffee."
1/31/2017 2:46,"unfortunately for you, you have lost my business and the business of my family. We are extremely disappointed in how you treat Americans."
1/31/2017 2:46,"Thank you for speaking up. I haven't been a huge fan, but I won't forget this."
1/31/2017 2:45,I usually make my own but I'll gladly drop by for a cup soon to say thank you for supporting diversity and decency!!
1/31/2017 2:44,Please don't let the haters get to you.  Keep doing what you want to do.
1/31/2017 2:44,I'll never buy another Starbucks product period until the CEO apologizes to Mr. Trump and to evey veteran looking for a job!
1/31/2017 2:43,How about putting politics aside and hire people who are best for the job. This is the last straw.  Bye Starbucks.
1/31/2017 2:42,Enjoyed my Starbucks even more today knowing that they stand with refugees. Thank you for doing the right thing.
1/31/2017 2:42,"Thank you for pledging to hire refugees in your stores worldwide, including prioritizing people who have helped the U.S. military, and also for your commitment to provide healthcare for employees, regardless of what happens to the Affordable Care Act."
1/31/2017 2:41,Bye bye Starbucks. I don't support companies who are treason against America.
1/31/2017 2:41,We are with you Starbucks.
1/31/2017 2:40,"So do you do ""suspended coffee"" at Starbucks? I know I can pay for the order after me but how about buying a coffee for someone homeless?"
1/31/2017 2:40,"Howard, Can't you shut up and just sell coffee?"
1/31/2017 2:40,"Instead of hiring 10,000 refugees why not hire 10,000 veterans?  Then fill that's still open with refugees.  Just a thought..."
1/31/2017 2:40,"I will no longer patronize Starbucks. Hire Americans, especially Veterans, 1st!"
1/31/2017 2:38,"I've been a Starbucks customer a long time, but that's over now!
HIRE VETS, NOT REFUGEES!!!"
1/31/2017 2:36,"Hey, why don't you HERE 10,000  Vets?"
1/31/2017 2:35,I've never been a huge fan of Starbucks but will deff make it a point to support this company every once in a while.
1/31/2017 2:34,If they boycott we will buy more!
1/31/2017 2:33,Instead of hiring refuges - why don't you give jobs to our veterans or the homeless that stand outside of your stores. Shame on you.
1/31/2017 2:30,How about committing to hiring homeless veterans? And how about not using a ruse stating your hiring people that helped veterans? You simply look pathetic stating you're going to hire refugees. How about hiring Americans?
1/31/2017 2:29,"Starbucks react to Pres. Trumps executive order by saying the will hire 10,000 refuges...What about all the American's that are out of work?
Just heard Joe Pages say this is affirmative action for refugees! Sounds like it to me!!!"
1/31/2017 2:29,I support Starbucks' vow to help refugees. Thank you.
1/31/2017 2:28,Starbucks should stick to coffee and stay OUT of politics. I won't shop there again when my prePay is spent. ICK...
1/31/2017 2:28,"I've been ordering the same drink for 10 years, since I worked for Starbucks when I was 19, you discontinued my syrup & I'm so disappointed. Ì†ΩÌ∏©"
1/31/2017 2:27,you should leave now. we've had enough of your socialism with a side of crappy coffee . . .
1/31/2017 2:27,"I guess my Starbucks card with $2.38 left on it will go to waste. I cannot support a company that will hire illegal refugees instead of veterans, doesn't want the business of people that support Pres Trump or of gun owners. Obviously, with wealth, wisdom didn't find this CEO. See ya."
1/31/2017 2:24,"So Starbucks will hire Syrian refugees over the next 5 years, but won't let a homeless vet ask for change outside their front door, NOR offer them a job ?"
1/31/2017 2:23,"Starbucks, why hire 10,000 refugees instead of 10,000 Americans or 10,000 American Veterans? Are Americans or American Veterans not good enough to be hired by you or are you just Anti-America and Anti-American Veteran? Guess you don't like supporting the Troops or anyone like that huh? Maybe they should just not support your company."
1/31/2017 2:21,"Starbucks, an American company that will hire immigrants. Go Starbucks. I will now buy all of my coffee from your company (always)"
1/31/2017 2:21,"To read Starbucks is willing to provide 10,000 jobs to refugees is totally appalling.  What happened to providing jobs to Americans,  Veterans, disabled individuals????.  I for one will not shop at any of your stores and if I can appeal to at least one and they another and another maybe it will make an impact on your bottom line.  How can we make America great again by giving jobs to immigrants fleeing other countries."
1/31/2017 2:20,"It's time the CEO of Starbucks leaves!  If you would rather hire refugees than veterans, it's over!  I'll short your company til the cows come home. You're a lousy person."
1/31/2017 2:20,How do I cancel my account?...
1/31/2017 2:19,Thank you Starbucks for standing up for what's right!
1/31/2017 2:15,Thank you Starbucks for agreeing to hire refugees!  thank you for hiring American vets!  Both of these actions stand for traditional American values.  Thank you for standing up to bullies!
1/31/2017 2:14,"I've lived in Seattle more on than off since 1983.  I got coffee from the cart under the old viaduct by the basement bookstore with the hotdog joint upstairs, before Westlake Mall was built.  And when I sold at the Market...well, we lived for our lattes on the line.  When you got so big, I sort of moved away, but when I literally moved to New York I started going back, because it was a little piece of home.  AND NOW...I am so PROUD OF YOU.  So proud of your stand!  I've got a gold card baby and I keep it with me always.  I buy your coffee to make in my house; I'll stop at my local supermarket to get a cup from your great baristas.  You are what is best about home grown US businesses who know what it means to give back to the communities that helped you thrive.  And now your stand for immigrants.  I LOVE YOU STARBUCKS, you Righteous Coffee Makers YOU!"

1/31/2017 2:13,Thank you for having the courage to standup for human rights!
1/31/2017 2:12,We will not shop at any of your stores
1/31/2017 2:12,"Dear Starbucks! I have to admit that I sometimes opt for smaller coffee shops to support my local businesses, but I have definitely been a customer of yours. Today however, hearing of your commitment to refugees and your courage to SPEAK with your ACTION in the face of this horrific administration, I am looking at your rewards program because I plan to frequent you more consciously -- I am relieved that someone believes in conscious capitalism. I will still be a loyal regular to my local coffee shops, and I will also be smiling when I'm ordering from YOU. THANK YOU!"
1/31/2017 2:12,Good job Starbucks.. you not only lost me but 1000's of other customers.  Way to get political.  Idiots.
1/31/2017 2:10,Today I sadly gave up that overpriced grande cup of coffee I love drinking 6-7 days/week.
1/31/2017 2:10,I had given up Starbucks as my New Years resolution to save money.   Now I WILL BE RETURNING TO STARBUCKS. I support companies that do right. IsuportStarbucks
1/31/2017 2:09,"Bravo, Starbucks!  For your pledge to hire 10,000 refugees around the world over the next five years.  I have not been much of a patron in the past, but from here on out I will be a regular and an advocate!!!"
1/31/2017 2:09,"Your massive expansion is exciting!!!  Clearly, hiring 20,000 employees will require many new stores.  You certainly aren't planning on hiring 10,000 refugees and ignoring 10,000 homeless, or American Vets or other unemployed Americans looking for work."
1/31/2017 2:08,"Your a disgrace to this country. There shouldn't be another American step foot in your shops. Bragging about hiring refugees, while our vets are homeless. YOU SUCK!!!  boycottstarbucks"
1/31/2017 2:06,Seriously love this company! Thank you for standing up and doing what is right.
1/31/2017 2:04,Kudos the Starbucks for the move on hiring refugees!! You are on the right side of history ‚ù§Ô∏è
1/31/2017 2:04,Thank you Starbucks! Don't worry we are here and support you!
1/31/2017 2:03,"I always liked you, Howard - bravo on standing up to hate!"
1/31/2017 2:03,"I'm boycotting this place. Planning to hire 10,000 immigrants/illegals instead of people here who need jobs? Are you crazy?! You just lost a valuable customer snowflakes!!!"
1/31/2017 2:03,Hire as many refugees as you'd like Ì†ΩÌ∏Ç is that supposed to make Trump supporters feel bad and unincluded? You're literally just pacifying the snowflakes and driving away part of your business. Good thing your coffee sucks and we have a Relax. Wayyyy better and worth the money Ì†ΩÌ∏Ñ
1/31/2017 2:03,Please leave America....
1/31/2017 2:02,Not only did I unlike your page but I will be encouraging everyone I know to boycott.  How about you do your part and hire our homeless off the streets?!?
1/31/2017 2:02,"Thank you for inspiring and nurturing the human spirit, and rejecting hatred and division."
1/31/2017 2:01,I'm sure you're getting all kinds of feedback lately. Just wanted to add my voice to those saying I was encouraged to see such a large company take a public stance on hiring refugees.
1/31/2017 2:00,Hey how does it feel to be the first company in the United States to openly discriminate against Americans seeking employment based on their race and/or religion?
1/31/2017 2:00,"Starbucks...keep doing what you are doing; thank you for your support of both veterans and all other peoples...Don't worry about our support of you, irregardless of the DT supporters who are threatening to boycott your product...they think they have the boycott power that we, non-DT supporters have as we have joined together and applied against their agenda lately - besides, I really don't believe that the Right wing has ever been your biggest fan anyway - so you're not losing much."
1/31/2017 1:59,unlocking - goodbye.  enjoy your 10000 refugee workers
1/31/2017 1:57,Thank you for wanting to hire the refugees I will continue to support Starbucks thank you
1/31/2017 1:57,Starbucks knee-jerk reaction to hire refugees instead of American workers is going to cost you when patriotic Americans refuse to spend their money with you.  You can say goodbye to my business and I will encourage my friends and family to do the same.
1/31/2017 1:55,Thank you Starbucks for your commitment to hire thousands and thousands veterans in 2014 and refugees in your store around the world as you ARE an international company. You've shown true dignity and grace under fire and I will go to your store as much as I can to combat the ignorance of people not reading your statement in its entirety.  SupportStarbucks
1/31/2017 1:55,"I am so sorry you have decided to only hire immigrants, I'm sure there are plenty of hard working Americans who would like to work for you! This is my favorite coffee and fortunately I bought French roast k-cups yesterday before I heard of your stand! Tomorrow I will use my Starbucks card which has money on it but after that I will no longer be able to buy your coffee since you apparently don't think Americans are worthy to be hired at your stores!"
1/31/2017 1:52,I just deleted your app. Please refund my money to paypal. When companies make inflammatory political stancescthere are repercussions. You have raised prices way beyond inflation lately and now you state you are going to hire 10000 refugees over American citizens. Good luck with that because their welfare benefits are much greater than your pay scale. You reap what you sow and I hope you get what you deserve.
1/31/2017 1:50,"I sent your company an email, regarding the statement that you would be giving jobs to 10,000 ""refugees"".  I received a form letter back that pretty much said, you don't really care what is thought by your customers, who are American citizens.  How many American citizens are losing their jobs so that you can give jobs to non citizens?  Unless of course you are opening thousands of new stores.  What about the citizens here who need Jobs now?  What about our military spouses or discharged military who need Jobs?  How about giving jobs to them?"
1/31/2017 1:48,Thank you for supporting our American melting pot!
1/31/2017 1:48,"A few things. 1)after I pay for my coffee the app isn't reflect ting that change on my card. Makes it difficult when I want to order and it still says I have x amount on card. 2)I was working on a dash that expires today and first it showed I had done nothing towards earning it and now it's no longer in the app. Please help. 
Lastly,bring back the BBQ brisket."
1/31/2017 1:47,I ‚ù§Ô∏è you Starbucks! I will continue to support your brand like I've been doing since you opened your first store in Arizona! No one is going to tell me where to spend my money!  ISupportStarbucks ‚úåÌ†ºÌøª‚úåÌ†ºÌøæ‚úåÌ†ºÌøΩ‚úåÌ†ºÌøº

1/31/2017 1:43,"Your company will never see another dime from me due to your CEOs plan to hire 10k refugees. Your company has the right to do it, I have the right to take my business elsewhere."
1/31/2017 1:43,I love you Starbucks! Ì†ΩÌ∏çÌ†ΩÌ≤™
1/31/2017 1:42,Just a little head's up for you ungrateful dirt bags I nor anyone I know will ever give your company another dime. All the money The American people have put into your coffers and this is your stance.I am asking for and to be honest expecting the immediate termination of your CEO for his comments regarding the hiring of 10.000 immigrants..
1/31/2017 1:42,"Who are you boycotting trash kidding? 95% of you have never even been inside of a Starbucks due to its elitist policy of ""No Shirt, No Shoes, No Pants: No Service""."
1/31/2017 1:42,Thank you Starbucks for supporting refugees!!! I am a loyal customer and am very happy that your company chose to do the right thingÌ†ΩÌ∏Ä
1/31/2017 1:41,Thank you for taking a stand against the immigration ban and defending the core values of your company. I respect your company so much!

1/31/2017 1:37,"I have for very many years been a fan and patron of your business. Today, I write to tell you, not that you care, I will never patronize your business again. To take a stand against America or the elected President of our country, whether you agree or not, is neither an American value or Patriotic. Further to use your resources and position to continue to fan the flames of division is irresponsible. I wish you ran a campaign with as much fervor to hire or help veterans as you are to offer employment to refugees. J. Scarfo, Orlando FL"
1/31/2017 1:34,Thank you so much for standing strong against discrimination and injustice. I have so much respect for you. I like your coffee now more than I ever did!
1/31/2017 1:34,"Looks like it's time for Tim Horton's here in the US. Just wondering how many of our Vets need a minimum wage job? With Trump bringing in the new jobs... or Vets now have the opportunity to make real money! And lets not forget the dear CEO supported Clinton in her run for Presidency. Clinton wanted to increase Obama's 10,000 Refugees accepted by America to 65,000 if elected. I guess these are the real people the CEO wants to hire. 
65,000 Refugees in American, who would they hire first then? Vets or the Refugee 
Yes Starbucks, you have made a statement that you are going to hire 10,000 Veterans/family members and you already have hired 8,800. My question is where is your loyalty once you hit your ""Magic Veteran Number"" Will you then start hiring illegals or refugees here in the states in stead of those who died to give you this right? Tell me where your real loyalties lay. Do they rest with our Men and Women of Service or to the Refugees? It's a simple question."
1/31/2017 1:34,I love the stand that you are taking for refugees. I will absolutely support you for this. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
1/31/2017 1:33,Your coffee sucks as bad as your politics
1/31/2017 1:32,"I've always liked Starbucks--but since you're aiding refugees I'm going in tomorrow to buy a $100 gift card.  For myself, of course. We need you to do what you do!!!   Thanks."
1/31/2017 1:31,"LOVE you, Starbucks.  Thanks for being the good guys in this awful world.  We will double our purchases!"
1/31/2017 1:31,Go to hell.  I will never buy another cup of coffee from you

1/31/2017 1:29,"I don't even like starbucks coffee, it's too bitter for me, but I'm going to go out of my way to get one and load it up with half and half!  Bravo Starbucks!"
1/31/2017 1:28,"How about you hire 10,000 of OUR 95 MILLION US CITIZENS who cannot find work instead of 10,000 refugees??? 0.39% loss today. Such moronic policies alienate half your potential customer base, so keep at it. But, rest assured, your stock is NO LONGER in my portfolio, Just too many SJW moves, it's nauseating."
1/31/2017 1:28,"SCREW YOU Starbucks!!! Going to lead a grassroots effort to boycott you! Hey, here's a thought....instead of hiring 10,000 immigrants you hire 10,000 VETERANS!! Or just hire 10,000 of the 95 MILLION Americans that are out of the work force!!!???"
1/31/2017 1:27,"Thank u Starbucks for your humanity!! Def will be buying more Starbucks!
Thx!!"
1/31/2017 1:26,"Very disappointed to see a PC display instead of a support of our country. Unlike. Unfollow. & UNFORTUNATELY choose another coffee vendor. 

What they are suggesting is against the law in the United States of America. AMERICANS may not hire based on race, creed, color, religion or gender."

1/31/2017 1:24,I am encouraging all my friends to immediately boycott your company. Your decision to hire refugees over American Citizens is insulting and borders on treasonous!  It's despicable and loathsome that you would do something like this !
1/31/2017 1:23,"Dear Starbucks,
  Why don't you just set the bar and hire both?"
1/31/2017 1:20,Thank you for taking a stance against tyranny.

Thank you for supporting the values that make this country a welcoming and inclusive place with your plan to hire refugees.  Please don't back away from this plan...it will not only be a good business decision but a front and center way to show that people are people are people...no matter what, and that love is always better than hate!"
1/31/2017 1:06,I'm  done with Starbucks...they are going to hire 10000 imigrants in the next 5 years.
1/31/2017 1:06,"I received a Starbucks GC as a gift. Since I decided to boycott Starbucks for your getting involved with politics, I would like to return it. I tried to return it today but I was asked for a receipt. Will you make it easier for people to return your GC? Please don't tell me to get a receipt from the person who gave me the card. Thanks."
1/31/2017 1:06,I will no longer be a customer of Starbucks.  Good Bye!
1/31/2017 1:05,LoveStarbucks
1/31/2017 1:05,"Just dropping by to say that I'm disgusted that you're pledging to hire immigrants over citizens. There's veterans, there's college students, there's the homeless. But no, of course not. I'm done with your business."
1/31/2017 1:02,Why not hire 10k American veterans?
1/31/2017 1:01,LOVE my Starbucks and will NOT boycott it!
1/31/2017 1:01,"How about you hire 10,000 Vets instead!"
1/31/2017 1:01,why would you ruin your business by getting involved in politics?? starbucks CEO sure isn't the brightest bulb in the pack. glad i like Dunkin and Wawa!
1/31/2017 1:00,"Why not hire veterans, displaced homemakers & struggling students?"
1/31/2017 0:59,"Thank you for standing up to hate. Now, if you'd only have gingerbread lattes year-round."

1/31/2017 0:57,Sell Great coffee stay out of politics. Now my family is forced to BOYCOTT.  SUCKS
1/31/2017 0:56,"I'm all for hiring those in need of jobs...but refugees?  I have always continued my support of Starbucks regardless of different political views but I can no longer do so.

With the plethora of American's in need of jobs, you chose to make a move that will seem redeeming and heroic in the eyes of liberals. When in reality, all you did was abandon citizens in need of a job to profit with the corporate breaks you'll get for hiring refugees at sub par pay.

Congratulations Starbucks...you can find someone else to maintain 8+ years of gold card status. I'm deleting my account and will be going elsewhere, like my friends have been urging me to do for years."
1/31/2017 0:56,Unliked! Unprofessional bad timing and Dunkin is better anyway
1/31/2017 0:56,"Hire our vets, our homeless our native AMERICANS first! You're a disgrace!!!!"
1/31/2017 0:55,"You don't support our elected president, I no longer support you! FinishedWithStarbucks Done"
1/31/2017 0:54,"Well, since you decided to hire refugees and possible terrorists in the countries that you have stores instead of the rightful citizens of those countries. My wife and I who have been 30 year customers of your company, have ceased doing business at your stores/products in protest of your stupid decision. We will be encouraging all our friends to do the same. Rational companies that have international ties, don't do what you are doing, to their host countries."
1/31/2017 0:54,"Yum! Just reloaded my card, and headed over to Starbucks for their new smoked butterscotch latte. I am taking refuge in its deliciousness, which I can only describe as 10,000 times more tasty than I originally expected!"
1/31/2017 0:53,"A huge thank you for your position. What goes around comes around...i will be your regular client for now on..i will pass the word and even when you have all these ignorant people, full of hatred and incapable of compassion, you will gain a lot more clients than the ones they are boycotting you. We are more, and when you stick with love , love comes back. Thanks again.."
1/31/2017 0:53,"I will continue to buy my coffee at Starbucks. I am not going to let ignorance perceive the mission of the American dream.. those who want to work will work, regardless of race. Continue the good work and the possibility to prosper."
1/31/2017 0:53,"Thank you for supporting refugees. As an immigrant and now citizen, I very much appreciate your support."
1/31/2017 0:52,HEY STARBUCKS-why don't you hire vets instead of illegal terrorists??? AND STOP LYING ABOUT IT!
1/31/2017 0:52,"Thank you Starbucks for not being afraid to do the right thing,( and also for having the best cappuccino Ì†ΩÌ∏É)."
1/31/2017 0:51,Shire the USA vets !!!!
1/31/2017 0:50,So you would hire immigrants over veterans? Well then....I will drink Dunkin over Starbucks!!! Idiots!
1/31/2017 0:49,You should be hiring people in our country. I'll never purchase your products again.
1/31/2017 0:49,Are you out of your mind? Your are about to loose a lot of business in America for some crazy decision your making. Make sure they are legle and paying taxes.
1/31/2017 0:48,I thank you for speaking up on the MuslimBan. I will continue to purchase Starbucks and perhaps even more frequently.
1/31/2017 0:48,"No more Starbucks for us.  Pete's coffee now has our undivided attention.  You are a business, and your political decision has consequences.  Our coffee business will be directed to those companies that choose to refrain form politics.  Your business plan should only focus on business."
1/31/2017 0:46,"Conservatives only care about homeless veterans when they can use them as a bargaining chip against accepting war-weary refugees fleeing violence and oppression, because helping the least of these is something Christ might do."
1/31/2017 0:46,I've consumed my last Starbucks coffee. It's a disgrace putting refugees before American citizens. I'm telling everyone I can to boycottstarbucks
1/31/2017 0:46,Why don't you hire veterans!
1/31/2017 0:43,Starbucks is run by traitors. BoytcottStarbucks
1/31/2017 0:42,"So you won't hire our unemployed and help our veterans, but you will hire refuges before Americans! I'm done with you Starbucks."
1/31/2017 0:41,"Since good for nothing refugees Trump Americans
I've bought my last Starbucks.
Entirely too many natural born Americans with out jobs and your company wants to punch them in the face"
1/31/2017 0:41,Congrats Starbucks!!  We love you
1/31/2017 0:41,"I don't know why you as a company think people want your personal views on politics/religion. Why don't you just shut up and serve coffee and stop trying to be the hero when all you do is piss off so many of your customers? Very sad you'd pick to hire refugees over American citizens. If you were to say you were hiring 10,000 jews, that would be discrimination, would it not? How about 10,000 white people? 10,000 atheists? Obviously you are a 2 faced company. Oh well I've been wanting to try Dunkin for a while anyways, I hear they are better, and less expensive :)"
1/31/2017 0:40,Thank you for pledging to employ refugees. I will enjoying my Starbucks coffee even more knowing your company is committed to extending compassion to these members of our community.
1/31/2017 0:40,I didn't get my 80 bonus points for getting 2 lattes.
1/31/2017 0:40,Starbucks has heart by standing up for human rights and dignity. I will gladly get my coffee here everyday.
1/31/2017 0:39,"Any chance you folks can just sell coffee and stay out of politics? It just riles everybody up and makes us ban your coffee, is that the point? Why do you have to dis half the country on a regular basis?"
1/31/2017 0:39,I will be drinking more Starbucks
1/31/2017 0:38,Used to spend about $30-40 a week at local store. Drive through for Misto and breakfast every week day.  No more!  I will never spend another dollar on anything Starbucks unless you start considering hiring more US Veterans vs. refugees.
1/31/2017 0:37,"Good job, read about pledge to hire 10k refugees worldwide! I'll be visiting my local starbucks this weekend in support."
1/31/2017 0:35,I didn't get my 80 bonus points for buying 2 lattes.

1/31/2017 0:27,"Thanks for shoving your political agenda down our throat.
Will no longer be going to any if your outlets"
1/31/2017 0:27,"Due to your blatant disrespect of the American people, as a vet and PAST customer, I feel I have the duty to discontinue any further investments into your overrated ""coffee"" establishment. It is an absolute disgrace that you chose to employ a refugee rather than a Veteran that fought for your right to even have that establishment. If in the future you decide to act like an american, I may consider reinvesting into your company, but until then I have a network of at least 50 close individuals and a very extensive social network......No need to let us know of the impact we are making, We know the avgs. and see you at a disadvantage. Thank you."
1/31/2017 0:25,"Thank you for your pledge to hire refugees!

A non-refugee who is sane."
1/31/2017 0:24,"Re- BoycottStarbucks

10,000 refugees to be hired throughout your 75 country chain, I think that's a great start. Now, if other int'l companies would follow the leader. 

Being a pensioner on a fixed income, I don't get to frequent Starbucks anywhere near as often as I'd like to. With that said, this will not deter me from enjoying my favourite drinks at the nearest Starbucks, when ever and where ever I go. Keep up the great work Mr. Schultz, you're an inspiration and I do hope other CEO's follow in your footsteps in this... 

This stupid hashtag war, that started in Mexico I believe, is also being pushed by none other than D. Trump. This man does not deserve to hold the highest office in your country, I pray for the welfare of ALL of your citizens.

Sincerely
Doug Barton"
1/31/2017 0:24,"SHAME ON STARBUCKS. CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY ARE NOT WORTHY OF YOUR JOBS, INSTEAD YOU PLAN TO HIRE IMMIGRANTS!! NOT IN MY COUNTRY. I. WILL BOYCOTT YOUR COMPANY AND ENCOURAGE ALL RESPECTABLE US CITIZENS TO DO THE SAME. KEEP YOUR COFFEE, I WILL TAKE MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE!"

1/31/2017 0:14,At least one of your products per day for about 10 years an estimate but close. In addition more frequently close to holidays and for larger gatherings and events both for personal and business related. After hearing decision to hire refugees before American citizens I promise never to buy a product of your design or marketing again. Only wish I could retract my support I have show over the last decade. Deplorable and ashamed of my indulgence and supporting of your business.  It may not hurt your bottom line as I am but one consumer but I'll boycott anyway and do everything I can to convince others to do the same. Starbucks is dead to me and will never support again in light of your on American political stance
1/31/2017 0:14,"I just love that you woke up one morning and decided to create 10,000 jobs on a whim. Why does it take a presidential travel ban for you to invent 10,000 jobs? Why offer them to only refugees? You've known about our struggling veterans, struggling single moms, and homeless epidemic  for YEARS.  Why not create jobs for them? It's amazing that you're  creating jobs, but America needs to stand together.  Announcing 10k jobs over the next 5 years immediately after the ban is not only spiteful but a slap in the face to our commander in chief.  He won. Accept it. Deal with it.  Support it."
1/31/2017 0:12,"Thank you for supporting human beings. I look forward to many more coffees served not by terrorists, but from one human to another."
1/31/2017 0:10,"Proud of you, Starbucks! I'm a former employee and I am proud that you are standing up to trump and his unconstitutional executive orders!! I know that you already hire Veterans, contrary to what some other posters are saying! Way to go!! Ì†ΩÌ≤öÌ†ΩÌ≤ö"

1/31/2017 0:07,"I spend a lot of money with you. But as soon as my balance is used up on my card, I will no longer be a Starbucks customer. Stick to making coffee and stay out of politics. You may not be offending everyone, but your positions are offensive to many. The funny thing is, you're managing to offend a group of people who are not easily offended! I've never boycotted a company. Ever. And up until now, I've ignored your politically inspired policies and practices; however, this latest move is simply too much."
1/31/2017 0:06,I find it VERY disturbing that you would opt to hire people that do not belong here while people like my son can't find a job! Thanks for nothing!
1/31/2017 0:04,My sister and I good riddance.  We feel that since you have made your polical bed we turn in our gold card.  We have spent thousands at your stores.  We are cutting up our gold cards.  There is quite a few friend that will say goodbye to you.   This such a good riddance.  Duanna Howell.

1/31/2017 0:01,I have been a Gold rewards club member for 8 years...and now Starbucks tells me is committed to hire refugees over American citizens and Vets?  I am preparing to make my own coffee over it.. Researching coffee makers now. If Starbucks prefers not to hire Americans and Vets first then I will not buy your products. I suspect many Americans will feel the same way. Believe the liberal media at your own risk.
1/31/2017 0:01,Thank you for your stance on refugees. I normally try to avoid Starbucks but will now become a regular Patron.
1/31/2017 0:00,I will never visit  your stores again
